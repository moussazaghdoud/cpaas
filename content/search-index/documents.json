    "content": "DocumentationApplications lifecycleApplications lifecycle Preamble Integrating the SDK into your application is the first step to use Rainbow. As for a user, an application needs to be identified. That's why, as a developer, you need to register an application in the Rainbow For Developers portal to obtain an application identifier that can be injected in your REST APIs or SDK. This document describes the way to get those credentials and the lifecycle of your application. It also summarizes the different things you can do depending on the state of your application. Application Environment and States There are two things to understand in order to know if your users can or can't use your application to connect to Rainbow. The application environment: This environment represents the right of your application to run on the production platform. The application state: This represents the current state of your application and depending on this state, the connection to the Rainbow Official Platform is authorized or not. Application Environment The application environment can take 3 values: Not deployed, In deployment and Deployed The following table recaps these information: EnvironmentDescription NOT_DEPLOYEDYour application is not allowed to access to the production platform. You have to deploy it.This is the default value when creating an application. IN-DEPLOYMENTYou requested the deployment (authorization to connect your application on the Rainbow Official Platform). ALE is checking your information to validate your request. DEPLOYEDYour application has been granted access to the Rainbow production platform and your users can connect to it. This status can be seen in the Rainbow For Developers portal for each of your application. Application State When your application is deployed on the Rainbow production platform (ie: Environment = DEPLOYED), your application can have the following states: running, stopped, blocked, deleted. The following table recaps these information: StateDescription RUNNINGYour application is authorized to connect to Rainbow.This is the default value when your application has been granted access to Rainbow. BLOCKEDYour application has been blocked by ALE due to API misuse or other bad behavior observed STOPPEDYou have manually stopped your application in order to avoid your users to connect to DELETEDYou have deleted your application. Nobody can connect anymore. Your application is no more visible in your list of applications Summary This table recaps from an end-user point of view, the possibility to connect or not to Rainbow depending on the state and environment of your application: EnvironmentStateDescription DEPLOYEDRUNNINGUsers can connect to Rainbow using your application DEPLOYEDBLOCKEDSTOPPEDDELETEDUsers can't connect anymore to Rainbow using your application NOT_DEPLOYEDIN_DEPLOYMENT-Users has never connected to Rainbow using your application To summarize, your users can connect to Rainbow only when the application environment is DEPLOYED and the state is equal to RUNNING. The next paragraph explains how to reach the right state and environment using the Rainbow For Developers. Note When using Rainbow CLI, application environment and application state are visible as separated properties. In the Rainbow for Developers portal, these two properties are aggregated in one \"Application state\" for simplicity. This value can be NOT_DEPLOYED, IN_DEPLOYMENT, RUNNING, BLOCKED, STOPPED. Application lifecycle The Rainbow For Developers provides all you need to successfully create and deploy your application easily. Registering a new application and getting application identifier and secret The first thing to do is to create a new application. To create it: Log-in to the Rainbow For Developers using your Rainbow user account (ie: email and password). On the left menu, select the option Applications Click on the button Create a New application to start the application creation wizard. Fill the form and submit it: Application name, Type and Activity. The application creation wizard displays the newly created application identifier and secret. These can be copied by clicking the button on the right of the identifier and secret values. If you need to get the application identifier and secret once the application creation wizard has been closed, you can edit your application and get them from the application edition page. The application identifier and secret are mandatory to be able to connect to Rainbow. You have to inject them in your application code. See the different part of the documentation of each SDK to understand how to inject these information into the SDK for authorizing your application to connect to Rainbow. Your application is now created.

    "content": "DocumentationRainbow's best practicesRainbow's best practices Here are some advices for helping you starting your integration with Rainbow. Follow API and SDK changes In 2021, we changed our SDK release and support policy to minimize the SDK update frequency for applications running in production. We now have two version tracks for C#, Web, NodeJS, Android and iOS SDKs: LTS (Long Term Support) : This is the recommended version you should use for an application running in production. LTS versions are supported for at least six months after they have been released. STS (Short Term Support) : You can use STS versions if you need the latest evolutions that are not already available in the current LTS version. We do not recommend the usage of STS versions if you don't really need it and for applications running in production. STS versions are not supported (we do not release corrections on this track). It's a best practice to update to the current LTS supported version in order to benefit support and stay closer to the latest evolutions in term of features, security and improvments. Previous LTS versions are not supported. In the same way, it's a best practice to move away from deprecated APIs as soon as announced for using stable APIs. Integrate our SDKs before moving to production Having an autonomous process that updates your application with the latest version of one of our SDKs is not good. The reason is that sometimes, a new version of a SDK comes with some breaking changes that you should handle manually. It's not a complex task because the migration path is described in our What's new guides but if not done, your application will not work correctly. A best practice is to integrate a new version of our SDK in your integration environment and once tested, move it to your production environment. Separate Rainbow concerns When integrating one of our SDKs or our REST APIs, you will manage a lot of methods to exchange data with Rainbow, a lot of events that will trigger callbacks and consequently a lot of Rainbow data. A good practice is to group the Rainbow stuff in one or several modules that are the only ones that connect to Rainbow and not to diffuse Rainbow data models everywhere in your app (except if Rainbow is the sole source of data used). Using that pattern, you will easily be able to debug, test and mock the Rainbow part in one hand and make changes according to Rainbow SDK or API evolutions in an other hand. Learn from the console logs When opening your development tool while using the SDK for Web or Android/iOS or if you have a look to the shell terminal that launches your Node.JS SDK process, you will see a lot of messages. These messages are initiated by our SDKs and give you a lot of information on what is currently happening. It's a best practice to use these information to understand and check that what is happening is correct. Don't forget to add these information when discussing with us on the forum or with our support team. Don't loop on API or SDK methods It's a good practice when developing your application to check that you are not writing loops that call Rainbow APIs or SDK methods. If for any reasons, you made a mistake in your code, you will send a lot of requests to Rainbow that will generate extra fees. Test on few Before releasing your applications to many users, it's a good practice to test your development on few users in order to check that all interactions with Rainbow are ok. The developers sandbox platform give you this possibility to test using fake accounts and so without disturbing real users. Experiment but don't hack If you don't find a proper way to do what you want, a good practice is to use the community forum to ask for help or for supporting a new feature. Trying absolutely to find a solution may cause side effects in your application if you're not using the Rainbow methods or data as they should be used. Prevent the worst Even if we garantee an uptime of the Rainbow platform higher than 99,5%, it's a good practice to handle all the bad things that can happen. Each SDK provides a lot of events that your application can subscribe in order to be alerted in case of the connection to Rainbow is lost. Same thing when something goes wrong such as if a chat message has not been successfully sent to your recipient. Design and implement security best practices Security and data privacy are paramount for Rainbow business, as well as yours. Bring confidence and security to your customers by integrating the industry best practices on the matter. Consider these topics early in your application and infrastructure design. You can find valuable resource explaining the main category of risks and vulnerabilities for web and mobile applications on the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) for example: OWASP Web Top 10 OWASP Mobile Top 10 - 2016 Take care of the data, take care of your users, take care of your business.

Sign-in a free Rainbow account A Rainbow account is mandatory to sign-in to the Rainbow for Developers portal. So the first thing to do is to sign-in a Rainbow account. This is free. One of the main reasons is because if you're a Rainbow user, we will be able to contact you easily through Rainbow to support you \"in live\". Once you have your Rainbow account, you can log-in to the Rainbow for Developers portal. The first time you will log-in, you will have to accept the Rainbow developer agreement. Once you did it, you will become a Rainbow developer and concretely your Rainbow account will be empowered to create and manage Rainbow applications. Your journey is starting... Connect and Develop This chapter describes how to start developping applications on our Rainbow Sandbox developer platform. Download SDKs and Starter-kits Once you have your account, you can start using our SDKs and APIs. The Rainbow for Developers portal presents each SDK in a dedicated web page containing a direct access to the online documentation, a link for downloading the SDK and some samples and starter-kits that you can use for starting your development. Activate your Developer Sandbox account If this is your first time developing a Rainbow application, we encourage you to activate your Developer Sandbox account. This is a free Rainbow account to be used on the Rainbow Sandbox platform. This platform is dedicated to developers, to let them play with our API and SDK without having to disturb real users. This platform is free of charge. Creating your Developer Sandbox account can be done from the section Sandbox in the left side menu. On this dedicated page, click on CREATE YOUR SANDBOX DEVELOPER ACCOUNT. You will receive an email with your sandbox account credentials. The sandbox account status displayed in the sandbox page should show \"ACTIVE\". You can now connect to the sandbox platform to handle sandbox applications (see \"Creating a test application\" below). IMPORTANT: Please note that your sandbox credentials are not the same as your main \"production\" credentials. This means you have two credentials information: one for the production platform and one for the sandbox platform. Read this guide to have more information on the Developers Sandbox platform. Creating tests accounts The sandbox account cumulates different roles so you can easily test your developments. These roles are: Rainbow user and application developer so you can connect to Rainbow sandbox platform and manage applications on this platform, Company administrator: when the sandbox account is created by the system, it is linked to a personal company named \"Company of <username>\". The company administrator rights allow you to manage test Rainbow user accounts on the sandbox platform for testing. As an example, these Rainbow users can be used when developing a chat application for simulating users. To create and manage your test accounts on the Rainbow Developer Sandbox platform, click on the link under \"To manage your tests accounts connect to\". This will open a new Rainbow web client tab. Connect with you sandbox account credentials, and go to the Administration tab. In the MyCompany / Members section, you will be able to list, modify, create and delete user accounts in your sandbox company (this is possible because a sandbox account has the company administration role for the sandbox user's own company). Remark: You can also install the Rainbow CLI command line tool to manage test user accounts. Read the guide Managing Test Accounts to have more information on how to manage your tests accounts using the Rainbow CLI. Creating a test application Once you have created your sandbox tests accounts, you will need a test application too on the sandbox platform. Any user who wants to connect to Rainbow needs to be identified by his credentials and by the application credentials. The application credentials are the application id and application secret. To create or manage applications on the sandbox platform you have to connect in the Sandbox section of Rainbow for Developers using the \"Connect to sandbox\" option. This will open a \"Connect to sandbox\" login popup where you can enter your sandbox credentials. Once connected, you will be able to list, modify, create or delete applications on the sandbox platform. Remark: the applications listed in the Sandbox section of Rainbow for Developers are only sandbox applications. To manage applications for the production platform, you have to go in the Applications section of Rainbow for Developers. Remark: Alternatively, you can also use the Rainbow CLI tool to create you sandbox applications. Read the guide Managing applications to have more information on how to create your test application using the Rainbow CLI. Remark: Applications created on the sandbox platform are"

    "content": "DocumentationDevelopment on SandboxDevelopment on Sandbox Our Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers is a testing environment that mimics the live Rainbow Production environment. It provides a secured space where you can test and develop your application without impacting any live Rainbow accounts. The Sandbox platform offers the same level of Rainbow API features as the production platform except for some Business and Enterprise grade services. By using Sandbox test accounts and their associated authentication credentials in your Rainbow application, you can test and debug without referencing any real Rainbow users and so avoid interactions with others real Rainbow users too. The next sections describe in details how to create your Developer Sandbox account and how to use it. Sandbox platform for developers vs Production platform Our Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers is a Rainbow environment similar to the Rainbow Production platform that can be used when developing your application. Only developers are allowed to access to this Sandbox platform. The aim of that platform is to let you discover and try our Rainbow SDKs and APIs without disturbing real users on the production platform. That's why this platform is independent of the Rainbow Production platform. So you can't interact with real users and consequently make mistake on your existing data, contacts, etc... On that platform, you can create as many tests accounts as you want. This is useful if you want to develop and test your chat or collaboration use cases. Free of charge The Rainbow Sandbox for developers is \"free of charge\" in order to let you familiarize with Rainbow. When you're using this platform to develop your application, there is no accrued charge when calling Rainbow API or services. The Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers may limit the usage of each API per day for security and performance reason. Developing on Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers The following sections describe how to register and use your Sandbox developer account and how to create and connect your application to the Rainbow Sandbow platform for developers. Activating your Sandbox developer account For developing and testing your application with Rainbow using our Developers Sandbox platform, you need first to activate your sandbox account. Here is the procedure: StepDescription Sign-in to Rainbow for DevelopersThe first step is to sign-in to the Rainbow for Developers login page with your Rainbow credentials. Activate your Sandbox accountFrom the Sandbox section located in the left side menu, click on Create your sandbox button.This action will create your account on the Sandbox platform. Get your credentialsOnce activated, you will receive an email containing your Rainbow credentials for connecting to the Sandbox platform. You have now activated your sandbox account. Creating your test accounts When you create your Rainbow sandbox account, a company is created with the name \"Company of <username>\". The Rainbow sandbox account is member and administrator of this personal company. Test accounts can be created in this company. These will be visible only inside the company itself. There are two options to create and manage test accounts on the Sandbox platform: The easiest way is to connect to the Rainbow sanbox web client (the link can be found in the Sandbox page of Rainbow for Developers). You have to connect to the Rainbow sandbox web client using your sandbox credentials. Then, click on the \"Administration\" tab, then \"MyCompany\" / \"Members\". The other option to manage test accounts on the Sandbox platform is using the Rainbow CLI command line tool: StepDescription Install the Rainbow CLIThe first step is to install our Rainbow CLI application for connecting to the Sandbox platform for developers.You need to install Node.JS and then the Rainbow CLI package. Connect the Rainbow CLILaunch the command rbw configure to configure your Rainbow CLI application with the sandbox credentials received by email.Launch the command rbw login to connect to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers. Create your test accountsOnce connected, to create test accounts, launch the command rbw create user like described in the guide Managing test accounts to create a test account Use your tests accountsYou can use or modify the accounts created either by using the Rainbow CLI application (use the command rbw commands to have the full list of available commands) or by using the Rainbow sandbox web client. Your test accounts are now ready. Now, you need to register an application to connect to Rainbow. Creating your application You must have an application identifier and secret key to identify your application on the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers like on the Rainbow Production platform.

This guide will help you to understand how to adapt your application for working with real users and for deploying it on Production platform. Steps Going to Rainbow production platform implies some modifications and actions to do. Here is the list of actions to do. The next sections will describe in details the different tasks needed to migrate your application. Register an application for production Up to now, you have an application that runs on the Sandbox platform. To run the application on the production platform, you need to use the Rainbow for Developers portal. Using the Rainbow for Developers portal, you need to obtain an application Id and a secret key that work on the Rainbow production platform. These information are mandatory for authorizing your application to connect to our Rainbow production platform. Do the following: Log-in to the Rainbow for Developers portal using your Rainbow user account. Be careful to not use your Sandbox account. On the left menu, select the option Applications Click on the button Create a new application. Fill the application creation wizard form (Application name, Type, Activity) Click the Create button The newly created application identifier and secret key are displayed. You can copy them using the buttons on the right of each field. To edit the application properties, locate the application in the applications table and click the edit button. Your application is not yet deployed. Deployment on the Production Platform To deploy your application on the Rainbow production platform, follow these steps: Ensure you have added a valid payment method for Pay As You Go offer applications. Visit the Billing section in the Rainbow for Developers portal, click Add a new card, provide your credit card information, and save it. You can also set up SEPA payment if preferred. For Pay As You Go offer applications: Your application will be automatically deployed upon completing the above steps, and it will become immediately accessible to your users. For Business and App Connect offer applications: Visit the Applications page in the Rainbow for Developers portal and click the deploy button. The application state will change to IN_DEPLOYMENT. Please note that in the case of Business and App Connect offers, the deployment must be validated by ALE before transitioning to the RUNNING state. Adapt your application To connect to the Rainbow production platform, adapt the application code as described: UsingTask to do Rainbow SDK for AndroidYou need to switch the value of the 3rd parameter of the API signin() from sandbox.openrainbow.com to openrainbow.com. Rainbow SDK for iOSYou need to use the connect() method. Rainbow SDK for CSharpYou need to switch the value of the 1st parameter of the API SetHostInfo() from sandbox.openrainbow.com to openrainbow.com. Rainbow SDK for WebYou need to replace the API signin() by the API signinOnRainbowOfficial(). Rainbow SDK for Node.JSYou need to switch the value of the parameter host in your configuration file from sandbox.openrainbow.com to openrainbow.com. REST APIYou need to switch the host used in your request from sandbox.openrainbow.com to openrainbow.com. Rainbow CLIIf you need to use the Rainbow CLI, you have to add the parameter --host openrainbow.com to the command rbw login or to launch the command rbw configure And secondly, you need to use the right application ID and secret key from the production platform instead of the ones from the Sandbox platform.Depending on your application, do the following: UsingTask to do Rainbow SDK for AndroidYou need to replace the value of the parameters applicationId, secretKey of the API initialize() with your application information. Rainbow SDK for iOSYou need to add the appID and appSecret in application delegates method application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions. Rainbow SDK for CSharpYou need to replace the value of the parameters applicationID, applicationSecretKey of the API SetApplicationInfo() with your application information.

They can chat, share files, start audio or video conferences, share their screens,... You can find more information about Rainbow bubbles usage on the Rainbow Help Center: Bubbles. Call A call is an audio only or audio and video interaction between two or more users. A call can be a CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) based call, a webRTC based call or a mixed CTI and webRTC call. A call can contain an additional application or screen sharing leg. A call always takes place into a conversation. Channel A channel is a Rainbow feature which represents a mass notification medium for sending information to a large number of users (several thousands in one time). More about Rainbow Channels on the Rainbow Help Center: Channels. Company Each user in Rainbow belongs to a company. When creating your Rainbow account, you belongs to the default Rainbow company. Then you can join an existing company to collaborate with your colleagues or create your own company. More information about Rainbow Companies on the Rainbow Help Center: What is a Rainbow Company? Contacts Contacts are Rainbow users that are in your network. More information here: How to add someone to my contacts Conversation A conversation represents the history of exchanges between you and another Rainbow user. This is all the interactions you had (i.e. calls, instant messages, files shared) and that you can retreive. A conversion is persistent. At any time, you could retrieve older interactions you did with someone. Deployed application A deployed application is a third party application that has been granted to connect to the Rainbow production platform. Developer This is a specific role a Rainbow user gains when registering to the Rainbow for Developers portal. This role is needed to create and manage third party applications. Developer Sandbox account This is a specific Rainbow account you have to use to connect to the Rainbow Developers sandbox platform for managing your Sandbox test accounts. Developer sandbox account credentials are different from the main Rainbow account credentials used to connect to the production platform. Instant messaging Instant Messaging is a Rainbow feature which allows to send and receive messages based on text, emoji, files and images. File sharing The file sharing is a Rainbow feature allowing users to share files. More information can be found here How to manage my Rainbow sharing Group Contacts in Rainbow can be gathered by defining groups. Groups allow to categorize and organize your list of contacts. Network This is the list of contacts with whom you are sharing mutually your availability: They see your availability, you see their availability. Organization An organization is a set of companies where users can see each other and collaborate. Presence The presence is a status in Rainbow that helps your contacts understanding if you can or not be reached at a time. More information can be found here: What does my contacts status mean. Privacy The privacy is a security mechanism that exists in Rainbow to protect your personal information from being accessible by other Rainbow users and to avoid unexpected interaction with Rainbow users that are out of your circle of activity (company or organization). Production platform This is the Rainbow platform where you are connected when using the AL-Enterprise Rainbow applications. Profile A profile (or a subscription) is a list of features a user can subscribe for. Several profiles exist in Rainbow: Essential, Business, Enterprise. By default, a user has the Essential profile. Third-party applications (CPaaS) overide the user profile to offer more. Push notifications The push notifications is the possibility for your mobile application to receive notifications from Rainbow when in background. Rainbow guest Represents a guest user in Rainbow. This is a restricted role a user can have (often associated to anonymous user) dedicated to third-party applications (CPaaS) and with a limited duration of life. Note: A Rainbow guest can't connect to a Rainbow application provided by AL-Enterprise. Rainbow user Represents a user in Rainbow. This is the default role you have when joining Rainbow. A Rainbow user can acces"

    "content": "DocumentationLTS SDK support policy & versionsLTS SDK Support policy and versions This guide lists the current supported versions of each SDKs and explains the different kind of versions. The new LTS SDK support policy applies to Web, NodeJS, C#, Android and iOS SDKs. It does not apply to ReactNative SDK for now as this SDK is still being developed. The new LTS rules do not apply to REST APIs. Supported versions Rules There are two version release tracks: LTS (Long Term Support): these are the SDK versions you should use if you want a stable version for a production use that is guaranteed to be supported for a minimum pre-defined time period, STS (Short Term Support): these are up-to-date SDK versions containing latest features, potentially unstable. As a developer using Rainbow SDKs for your applications, LTS versions are the way to go except if you need latest Rainbow features not already integrated in the LTS version. Versioning The version number of an SDK will show immediately if this is an STS, LTS beta or LTS version: STS versions will have no suffix, Beta LTS versions will have a -ltsbeta suffix. LTS versions will have a -lts suffix. LTS in details We release LTS versions that we consider stable. As software developers, you know that code modification can accidentally introduce bugs or unwanted behavior. That is why the basic rule is that an LTS version never receives new features and receives only fixes considered as critical. Before releasing a new LTS version we will release an LTS beta version. This version will contain all features of the LTS release version. Support duration: LTS version is supported for at least the time period that was announced when this version has been released. The LTS version support ends one month after the next LTS version is released. The previous LTS version is then deprecated. No support will be delivered for deprecated LTS versions. Update to the currently supported LTS version is required. If an issue is found in a deprecated LTS version, the SDK must be first updated to the currently supported LTS version. Bug fixes: If a major or critical issue is discovered in the LTS version a fixed LTS version is released. Even if the non-fixed LTS version continues to be supported it is highly recommended to update to the fixed LTS. At any time, there is only one fixed LTS version: this fixed LTS version cumulates all fixes since initial LTS version was released. This means there is no more than two LTS supported versions at a time: non-fixed LTS, fixed LTS (the latest containing all fixes found). Breaking changes: When a new LTS version is released, it can bring breaking changes (even if we try to avoid them). This means that when updating from a previous LTS, code change can be required in your application. Migration of the code will be described in the LTS release note. STS in details STS version are released on a frequent basis. These versions contains latest features and bug fixes. Support duration: STS versions are supported in a best effort mode until the next STS version is released. This means issues can be posted on our Community Forum. We will do our best to handle them. If a fix is needed, it will be available in the next STS version. Breaking changes: We try to limit breaking compatibility between versions but this can happen in the STS release track. We will document these changes in STS release notes. Beta phase: STS releases are to be considered as next LTS development versions (these can be seen as next LTS alpha versions). They contain features that will be available in the future LTS version. During the STS release track, we will qualify an STS release as \"LTS beta\". This means we will freeze features and focus on bug fixes until quality level is sufficient to release next LTS version. SDK Documentation The SDK documentation is available on the Rainbow for Developers. The documentation for the latest Long Term Support and Short Term Support versions are available. Documentation for previous versions are not available. For accessing to STS documentation, authentication and being registered as developer is required. In menu Profile you can select documentation to display. The selection is global to all SDKs (for example if you select LTS, you will read LTS documentation for all SDKs). There can be cases where only one version of the documentation is available: For example, when a new LTS version is active and no new STS version has been released since. If the user selects 'STS', a page will be displayed explaining there is currently no STS documentation available for this SDK. 'LTS' documentation will be available for the active LTS SDK version. The global documentation selector has two choices: LTS for the currently active Long Term Support SDK documentation STS / LTS Beta for the currently active Short Term Support SDK documentation or the currently active LTS Beta SDK documentation. As explained before, an STS version can be qualified as LTS Beta when it"

    "content": "DocumentationCore conceptsRainbow core concepts Preambule To be able to develop your application that connects to Rainbow, you need to have in mind some key concepts. These concepts are in the core of Rainbow and called pillars. Knowing them, will help you understanding how Rainbow works and what are the rules behind. In Rainbow, there are 4 pillars or concepts: The concept of Entity The concept of Membership The concept of Relation The concept of Right This guide describes these pillars in details and illustrates how and why Rainbow is called the relationship machine. Rainbow entity An entity is something or someone that can be identified in Rainbow. Entities can be various and not only address users. Things like an iot device or a PBX are entities too. Each entity has an unique identity. The identity is the way an entity is identified and distinguished from others. An identity contains various information like a name, an avatar, an id... Information are different depending on the entity (ie: users, sites...). Each identity share a important information called the id. This identifier is the main information to interact with an entity. Using this identifier, you're are able to call Rainbow API for getting the associated vcard of this entity (depending the privacy rules - see next paragraphes) and to communicate with him. In fact, as Rainbow uses an XMPP engine for communicating in live between entities, there is always a second identifier called the jid that is used in association with the id. Internally, this is the jid that is used when for example a user wants to contact an other user in live. But both always exist. The id is the key information to use to identify a Rainbow entity. Rainbow membership The membership is a concept associated to companies, sites and organizations: A company is used to define affiliations for users. Like other entity, a company has an id and a lot of others information like a logo, a slogan that can be used to promote and reinforce its identity. And by consequences all entities belonging to this company will benefit from these information. A site can be used to associate systems inside a company. An organization groups companies inside a unique set to define specific affiliations. In Rainbow, each 'living' entity has a membership. For example, if you're a single user, by default you belong to a virtual company called 'Rainbow'. This membership defines the limits of the interactions entities can have together. Concretely, membership is based on the principle of visibility. The visibility is the way a company, an organization, a user and so any entity is visible from an other entity. Visibility can be public or private. In some words, if an entity is public, the entity can be found in the search field using a Rainbow client. If entity is private, it is private and so can't be found. The last thing to understand regarding on the membership is that information of entities is protected by privacy rules. Imagine that someone who has a private visibility calls someone who is public. The user in the public company will only have access to a minimal set of information of the private user. Information, like the loginEmail will not be available. You will access only to information that let you distinguishing the user (ie. name, photo, company). You can find additionnal information on the visibility by reading the guide Visibility and privacy rules. Rainbow relation A relation in Rainbow is how two entities \"keep in touch\" and so can quickly initiate a new interaction or continue an existing one together. Rainbow relations can be spontaneous when searching for someone and initiating an audio call, long-term when reopening and interacting again in chat or webRTC with a user, or privileged when the entity you contact is in your network. The type of relation you have with other Rainbow entities is very important because depending on it, you can or not have access to the entity availability information. The availability is all information you can share regarding your activity. At this time of writing, the availability is composed of Your presence activity: Are you online, dnd, away, in a video call ? Your business phone activity: Are you engaging in an audio call or not ? Your calendar activity: Are you in a meeting, out of office ? Until when ? You availability is only shared when you have a privileged relation with your recipient. Privileged relation needs an acknowledgment from your recipient, so you need to ask him by sending him an invitation to be in his network. If your recipient accepts, you will be in his network and he will be in your network. You have now a new privileged relation with a user. Be careful, it's not because your recipient is in your network that he has access to your network's contact. Being in the network of someone only allows to access to his availability. A privileged relation can be done with someone that is in the same company as well as with someone that is i"

    "content": "DocumentationREST API and SDK stability policiesRainbow REST APIs and SDKs stability and compatibility policies This document describes how ALE International supports and deprecates legacy Rainbow REST APIs, Rainbow SDKs, Rainbow CLI tool and Rainbow open-source libraries published to give developers time to transition to the latest version or at least a compatible one. Rainbow REST APIs policies The following policies rules apply to all Rainbow REST APIs published in the Rainbow for Developers platform. Rainbow REST APIs compatibility policy Wherever possible, Rainbow REST API resources and their representations (i.e. parameters sent and received) will be maintained in a backwards compatible manner. This means that Rainbow REST APIs are backwards compatible: A program written against one version of that API will continue to work the same way, without modification, against future versions of the API. If it is necessary to change an API resource or representation in a way that is not backwards compatible (breaking change), a new resource will be created using the new representation, and the old resource will be maintained in accordance with the deprecation policy, described at the end of this document. Rainbow REST APIs stability policy Rainbow REST APIs fulfill the following stability rule: An existing resource and his representation will continue to exist with the same meaning in future versions. This means: The meaning of HTTP response codes can be trusted. Each API may return several HTTP response codes but these codes once defined never change. No new HTTP response codes are introduced in existing API once published. A resource may support additional query parameters in future versions but they will not be mandatory. The absence of a value or a default value (as appropriate) will maintain prior behavior. If a resource accepts a representation (e.g. via POST or PUT), it will continue to accept the same representation in future versions. Additional properties that are recognized in a resource will not be mandatory, and the default value assumed in their absence will be chosen to maintain the previous meaning of the resource. Representations based on media type \"Application/JSON\" have additional stability guarantees such as: If a property exists in a JSON object returned by the REST API, it will continue to be returned with the same name, and the same value type (i.e. String, number, array or object). If a property has a primitive type and the APIs documentation does not explicitly limit its possible values, clients must not assume the values are constrained to a particular set of possible responses. If a property of an object is not explicitly declared as mandatory in the API, clients must not assume it will be present. New properties may be added to a representation at any time, but a new property must not alter the meaning of an existing property. If a property of an object is a URI, then the resource identified by that URI must maintain the same compatibility guarantee. In some specific cases, the behavior of a Rainbow REST APIs may change without explicit deprecation period if the existing behavior is incorrect or constitutes a security or privacy vulnerability. In that cases, the changelog will describe the issue and a possible workaround if exists. Rainbow REST APIs having incorrect resources or representations may be changed to fulfill REST architecture requirements. For example, in case of APIs with content type \"Application/JSON\", the parameters names and values may be modified if they are considered as incorrect (e.g. API that returns 'null' instead of an empty array when returning an empty list of users). This is considered as bug and will be corrected as soon as possible. Rainbow REST APIs that constitute a security or privacy vulnerability may be blocked resulting in an HTTP 404 not found when calling these APIs. That case may be temporary. Rainbow REST APIs resource/rate limits and paging policy Resource rate limits, if any, and the default and maximum sizes of paged data are not considered part of the APIs and may change without explicit deprecation period and policy. For example, an API can be changed to return by default only the 30 first results instead of the 100 first one to optimize bandwidth consumption. Resource rate limits and default and maximum sizes of paged data are described in the APIs documentation published on the Rainbow for Developers for all APIs concerned. When changed, the APIs documentation will be updated and the changelog will summarize those changes. See the deprecation policy chapter. Rainbow SDKs and Rainbow CLI tool policies The following policies rules apply to all Rainbow SDKs published in the Rainbow for Developers platform (i.e. SDK for Web, SDK for Node.JS, SDK for C#, SDK for Android, SDK for iOS and SDK for ReactNative) and for the Rainbow CLI tool. Rainbow SDKs and Rainbow CLI tool compatibility policy Wherever possible, Rainbow SDKs and the Rainbow CLI "

Support Depending on your need, here is how you can be supported. Need support when developing If you have questions on how to use our SDKs or APIs, use our developer's community forums to post your requests in order to share the answers to all developers. A good practice is to : Give us the context: Which API or SDK you didn't succeed to use. On which platform, etc... Explain you case: Give you some details on what you want to do. Add an extract of your existing code: Give a a code snippet of the part of code that don't work. Need support when finding an issue Depending the type of Rainbow SDK version used by your application (either STS or LTS), the support path is different: LTS is our stable version stream meaning we provide official support for these versions, STS is our unstable version stream, providing latest features, we provide limited support for these version. Refer to SDK Supported Versions for details about our Rainbow SDK support policy. Issue found in a Rainbow SDK STS version If you think you found an issue in a Rainbow SDK STS version: verify you use the currently released Rainbow SDK STS version. If this is not the case, update to the current STS version and check if issue still exists, gather the information listed in the Required information for a suspected issue paragraph below and every detail that is susceptible to ease investigation of the issue, post the suspected issue description and information to our Developer's Community Forum. Our team of experts will do their best to analyze and answer to your post. If the issue if confirmed, a fix will be included in a future STS version. Issue found in a Rainbow SDK LTS version If you think you found an issue in a Rainbow SDK LTS version: verify you use the officially supported Rainbow SDK LTS version. If this is not the case, update to the current LTS version and check if issue still exists, gather the information listed in the Required information for a suspected issue paragraph below and every detail that is susceptible to ease investigation of the issue, contact our ALE Support Team: by email support@openrainbow.com, with Rainbow by sending a message to our bot Emily. After a first analysis, a ticket will be opened and an answer will be provided in a short delay. If a fix is needed, an update of the current LTS version including the fix will be released. Required information for a suspected issue You will need to give us some additionnal information about the problem encountered: The context of the issue, with some information on your use case and your environment. The operation done which is the API or SDK method you are calling with a little snippet of your code that can reproduce the issue. The result observed generated by the SDK or API.

It should be done carefully to avoid any security issue. This guide will explain in details: The kind of Rainbow applications you can build How to authenticate your users for each kind of applications Best practices to secure your secret key and to protect Rainbow users data. Kinds of applications There are four kind of applications that exist: Rainbow applications: We call Rainbow applications the applications delivered by ALE International. These applications are out of the scope of this guide. Rainbow sibling applications: We call Rainbow sibling applications or just Rainbow siblings, any application that asks the user to log-in with his Rainbow credential. Each time you are building this kind of application which can be a connector, an extension or a Rainbow plugin that allows to access your Rainbow account and data in order to leverage your Rainbow experience. These applications augment the Rainbow features and integration with others platforms. Rainbow sibling services: We call Rainbow sibling services, any backend application that either dialogs with existing Rainbow users such as a bot or automates provisionning or management of Rainbow accounts such a business process connected to Rainbow that creates new Rainbow accounts. Rainbow third party applications: All others applications are called Rainbow third party applications. Theses applications have already an authentication mechanism offered by the third party platform (ie: your application and platform). In that case, your application will use Rainbow to offer new services \"as if they have been developped\" by you. Your application consumes Rainbow as a service. Note: If you don't know the kind of application you are building, ask you if your application can interact with existing Rainbow users. If yes, you are probably developing a Rainbow sibling application or service. If you don't want any interaction from Rainbow users because your application is dedicated to your own users with user profiles managed by your platform, you are building a Rainbow third party application. SUM-UP Kind of applicationsDetails Rainbow siblingsRainbow users connect using their Rainbow accounts in these applications.Interactions with Rainbow users using Rainbow applications or other Rainbow sibling applications could occur and have to be managed.These applications access your Rainbow identity and all the data you generated on Rainbow. You can generate new Rainbow data from these applications. Rainbow siblings servicesThese services are running on a backend infrastructure that is connected to Rainbow.Interactions with Rainbow users using Rainbow applications or other Rainbow sibling applications could occur and have to be managed.Depending on the level of rights, the Rainbow account used to provide the service can access or not to the profile of Rainbow users and manage them. These applications have no access to users data. Rainbow Third partyUsers of these applications are existing users of a third party application. These users are not aware of Rainbow and so Rainbow credentials are not known by them. They log-in using their third party credentials and receive a token on behalf the Rainbow users to be able to make requests to Rainbow.These applications create new Rainbow users. Interactions with Rainbow applications, Rainbow sibling applications, Rainbow sibling services or any other not managed third party applications should not happen to avoid unexpected behavior. Authentication methods The following points are good practices for securing your application and the data of your users. You should follow them carefully when in production. For development on the Sandbox platform, you can work without them. For Rainbow sibling applications Authentication method offered for Rainbow sibling applications is based on using a Basic Authentication from the application with the Rainbow credentials of the users. Rainbow SDK for C#, Rainbow SDK for Web and Rainbow SDK for NodeJS support OAuth2 authentication mecanism in addition to basic authentication. For Rainbow sibling services As mentionned, Rainbow sibling services work on a backend that can be hosted on our own datacenter, on a cloud hosting specialist or by us. Rainbow accounts used by these backend services can authenticate directly to Rainbow either using the Rainbow Authentication REST API provided or the SDK for Node.JS if permitted by the backend. The following diagram describes the complete flow. The main points are the following: Sibling services use Rainbow accounts that have to be created manually with the desired level of rights. Depending the services provided, REST API can be used instead of the SDK for NodeJS. Both cases work in the same way. For Rainbow third party applications As mentionned in the table above, authentication of these applications relies on the third party "

    "content": "DocumentationRainbow usersRainbow users Preamble Rainbow users are in the center of the relationship machine. Understanding how Rainbow users are managed and work is important to build the best experience in your application. This guide describes in details some main concepts that you need to know: What are the different roles of users in Rainbow and the associated rights ? How profiles impact the rights of a user ? How applications impact the rights of a user ? Why the user's company location is important ? Introduction on roles in Rainbow In Rainbow, different roles exist to offer individual experiences: Sometimes, you need to have users with a limited connection time while sometimes, you need to do administrative tasks such as creating new Rainbow accounts. These different behaviors can be obtained by giving to the user who executes the action a specific role. In Rainbow, there are three main different roles: The User role, the Guest role and the Administrator role. All these kind of users may interact each other and are not limited to dialog with users of the same role. User role The user role is the basic role used in Rainbow. By default when creating an account you have the user role. With this role, a user can interact with anybody by actions like sending an instant message, calling in audio or video, sharing his computer screen, a file, etc... The main characteristics are: Accounts with user role never expire (as opposed to accounts with guest role). Accounts with user role can connect to our ALE Rainbow applications and are not limited to third party applications (as opposed to accounts with guest role). Accounts with user role can't do administrative tasks (as opposed) to accounts with administrator role). Account of type user can be created by using the Node.JS SDK or directly from our REST APIs. Guest role (CPaaS role) The guest role can be seen as the user role but with a limited set of capabilities and a limited life duration. Concretely, this role has to be used when a user will have a short interaction with Rainbow such as when visiting a Web site and when this interaction could stay anonymous or with a limited identity (for example we don't need that the user logs in to his account). The main characteristics are: Accounts with guest role expire. By default after 48 hours but this duration can be fixed guest by guest at creation step. Once expired, Rainbow interactions are refused for this account. Accounts with guest role can't connect to our ALE Rainbow applications. These accounts have to be created and used exclusively in third party applications. Accounts with guest role can't have a network: No user can be added to the guest's network (subject to change). Accounts with guest role can’t be added to a user's network. Accounts with guest role can’t do search (subject to change). Accounts with guest role can't be found by search. Accounts with guest role can’t post a file (can receive files). Accounts with guest role can’t create a bubble, a channel or a group (can be added into bubbles, channels or groups). Accounts with guest role can't be associated to a PBX device. Account of type guest can be created by using the Node.JS SDK or directly from our REST APIs. 💡 NOTE Don't confuse CPaaS user Guest role with the UCaaS feature joining a Bubble in guest Mode. UCaaS guestMode is totally independent of CPaaS role. It was designed for joining a Bubble with meet.openrainbow.com for users without any account. Administrator role The administrator role don't exist practically but is in fact a set of different roles for doing administrative, provisionning or business tasks. The most common administrator role is the admin role. When having the admin role, an account can do administrative tasks and provisionning tasks. Two types (meaning levels) of admin roles exist: the company_admin type and the org_admin type. The role admin of type company_admin is given to any accounts who manage a company and the users included. When managing several companies, we use the role admin of type org_admin. For Business Partners, others roles exist for being able to buy & sell licenses such as bp_admin and bp_finance. For developers, they are administrators of their owned applications and so have the role of app_admin. The main characteristics are: Accounts with administrator role never expire. Accounts with administrator role have the user role too. An account can have several administrator roles such as admin and app_admin. Accounts with admin or app_admin role can't do business tasks (unlike accounts with bp_admin or bp_finance role). Accounts with admin or bp_admin/bp_finance can't manage applications (unlike accounts with app_admin role) Rights in Rainbow Rights given by roles As described in the previous paragraph, the role gives to the account a set of global rights that can be divided between Communication right, Administration right and Business right: Communication right is the right to send and receive ins"

    "content": "DocumentationVisibility and privacy rulesVisibility and Privacy rules There is an important concept in Rainbow that you can't ignore because this will have an impact on your development. This is about Rainbow identity. A Rainbow identity is the unique digital identification of someone or something. This is who you are in Rainbow and how you are seen by others. And as an identity can be applied to a bot, to a IOT device, to everything that can connect to Rainbow, this is how this entity is identified in Rainbow. In Rainbow, identities follow 2 kinds or rules: The Rainbow visibility rules The Rainbow privacy rules You need to understand how these concepts work if you want to connect people and things. This guide will help you understanding these concepts. Visibility In Rainbow, when you search for someone or something using his or its name and when there is no result returned, you can't conclude immediately that the user or the thing has no Rainbow account. An account can exist but due to his or its visibility, you have not the right to find him or it and so to interact with him or it. This is called the visibility rules. These visibility rules depends on two criterias: The visibility of the surrounding Rainbow company The visibility of the Rainbow account representing a user or a thing. Visibility of Rainbow companies Regarding the visibility of a Rainbow company, the value can be public, private or organization which in fact is equivalent to visible or not visible. Visibility of the companyRule PublicA public company is visible from other companies. All Rainbow accounts created in that company are public too. PrivateA private company is not visible from other companies. Rainbow accounts created in that company could be public or private. OrganizationAn organization company that is visible only by companies from the same organization. Rainbow account created in that company are public from inside the organization and private from outside the organization. Visibility of Rainbow accounts Regarding the visibility of a Rainbow account, the value can be public or private which in fact is equivalent to visible or not visible Visibility of an accountRule PublicA public Rainbow account is visible from any others Rainbow account.Limited to companies in the same organization when the surrounding company has a visibility organization. PrivateA private Rainbow account is visible only from Rainbow accounts of the same company. Consequently, a private Rainbow account is not visible from Rainbow accounts outside its company. Visibility of Rainbow accounts in the default Rainbow Company Rainbow accounts that are not attached to a specific company are attached to a virtual default company called 'Rainbow'. This virtual company (Rainbow) is public which means that any Rainbow accounts are public too. Rainbow Visibility rules The visibility rules are the following: Rule #1: If you know only the name or the loginEmail of a user, you are able to find the Rainbow associated account only if this user is public or in the same company as you. Rule #2: If you know the id or the jid, you will be able to find Rainbow associated accounts no matter if the account is public or private. Privacy In Rainbow, when you search for someone or something and when you find him or it, you can see that depending on the user found, you have not access to the same level of information due to the privacy. This is called the privacy rules. These rules allow to protect your identity from other users and avoid other users to stole or use information without your consent. Basically, there are 2 levels of privacy: The restricted level: Only a subset of information is accessible. The full level: All information of the user's identity is accessible. Restricted level of information When you have only access to a restricted level of information of a Rainbow account, you have access to the following information. Note: Depending SDK used, fields name can be different. FieldsDescription idThe account id jid_imThe account JID IM firstnameThe account firstname lastnameThe account lastname companyThe company name companyIdThe company Id guestmodeTrue if the account is a guest lastUpdateDateThe last time the information has been updated. lastAvatarUpdateDateThe last time the avatar has been updated. If null, no avatar has been set isTerminatedTrue if the account has been closed Note: An additional loginEmail field is received when the searched user is part of the same company of the user who made the search. Full level of information When you have a full access to an account information, you will be able to retrieve all the fields from the restricted and all other fields filled. FieldsDescription idThe account id jid_imThe account JID IM firstnameThe account firstname lastnameThe account lastname companyThe company name companyIdThe company Id guestmodeTrue if the account is a guest lastUpdateDateThe last time the information has been updated. lastAvatarUpdateDateThe l"

These steps are mandatory in order to have access to services such as voice and video calls, chat or files sharing, etc... Rainbow conceptDescription Sandbox platform for developersThis Rainbow platform is dedicated to developers.The Sandbox platform for developers is not connected to the Production platform and let developers be familiar with our APIs and SDKs.This platform uses different users accounts and application Id. Some limitations can occur regarding the performance and availability. Production platformThis Rainbow platform is the official one with all Rainbow services and infrastructures enabling a high availability and accessibility all over the world.For using it, you need to create and deploy an application.This is the platform you use when connecting with our Rainbow applications. Preamble Incorporating the SDK facilitates connectivity with Rainbow through two distinct mechanisms: HTTP REST Requests: REST requests are used to interact with Rainbow services to perform actions such as creating a Room, inviting users, etc. They are executed through the various APIs available in the SDK modules. For most APIs, the user must be authenticated. Persistent Websocket Connection: The SDK establishes and maintains a persistent connection to Rainbow through a WebSocket, enabling real-time event reception. This connection enables instantaneous updates, including incoming chat messages, call notifications, and various dynamic events. The WebSocket remains active while the application is in the foreground but suspends when the application moves to the background. To continue receiving notifications when the application is in the background or closed, it's essential to subscribe to Push Notifications. This step ensures uninterrupted notification delivery. The SDK automatically manages the WebSocket connection post user authentication and provides monitoring capabilities via the RainbowSdk().connection().state property This tutorial assumes that you have followed the Getting Started tutorial and that you have an active Rainbow application. Sign-in to Rainbow kotlin java RainbowSdk().connection().signIn(email, password, object : Connection.ISignInListener { override fun onSignInFailed(errorCode: Connection.ErrorCode, error: RainbowError<Unit>) { val errorMessage = when (errorCode) { Connection.ErrorCode.CONNECTION_WRONG_LOGIN_OR_PWD -> \"Incorrect username or password\" else -> \"An error occurred\" } // Handle error cases } override fun onSignInSucceeded() { // User authentication successful } }) RainbowSdk.instance().connection().signIn(email, password, new Connection.ISignInListener() { @Override public void onSignInFailed(@NonNull Connection.ErrorCode errorCode, @NonNull RainbowError<Unit> error) { // Handle error cases } @Override public void onSignInSucceeded() { // User authentication successful } }); You can find all the connection error cases in the documentation for the ErrorCode class. During the authentication phase, the RainbowSdk().connection().state property will transition between these states: DISCONNECTED -> Before calling the sign-in method AUTHENTICATING -> During the call to the sign-in method AUTHENTICATED -> After successful authentication READY -> When the XMPP connection is established After authenticating the first time, the connection information is saved and can be retrieved in the RainbowSdk().user() module. kotlin java val storedLogin = RainbowSdk().user().userLoginInCache val storedPassword = RainbowSdk().user().userPasswordInCache String storedLogin = RainbowSdk.instance().user().getUserLoginInCache(); String storedPassword = RainbowSdk.instance().user().getUserPasswordInCache(); Sign-in on a different host The sign-in methods within the SDK module offer a version that enables specifying the authentication host. This functionality provides the flexibility to select between platforms, such as the sandbox or production, as needed. kotlin java RainbowSdk().connection().signIn(email, password, \"sandbox.openrainbow.com\", object : Connection.ISignInListener { override fun onSignInFailed(errorCode: Connection.ErrorCode, error: RainbowError<Unit>) { val errorMessage = when (errorCode) { Connection.ErrorCode.CONNECTION_WRONG_LOGIN_OR_PWD -> \"Incorrect username or password\" else -> \"An error occurred\" } // Handle error cases } override fun onSignInSucceeded() { // User authentication successful } }) RainbowSdk.instance().connection().signIn(email, password, \"sandbox.openrainbow.com\", new Connection.ISignInListener() { @Override public void onSignInFailed(@NonNull Connection.ErrorCode errorCode, @NonNull RainbowError<Unit> error) { // Handle error cases } @Override public void onSignInSucceeded() { // User authentication successful } }); Host Connection Rules When utilizing a "

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to integrate contact management features into your Android application with ease. We'll cover accessing the user's roster, creating and managing personal contacts, and listening to changes in this information for updating your application's UI. Rainbow conceptDescription IRainbowContactRepresents the public interface for accessing information about Rainbow contacts, including the logged-in user. This interface is utilized and returned by various SDK functions. RosterIn XMPP, one's contact list is called a roster, which consists of any number of specific roster items, each roster item being identified by a unique JID (usually of the form contact@domain). For more information, refer to RFC 6121. Personal contactsA personal contact is one that you create and manage, exclusive to your account. You have full control over these contacts, allowing you to customize and utilize them according to your preferences Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have completed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials, and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before proceeding with contacts management, ensure the following: Your development environment is configured according to the guidelines in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as outlined in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have obtained the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. With these prerequisites in place, let's explore the features of contacts management with Rainbow SDK for Android. Access the user's roster The user's roster contains contacts that the user has invited, serving as both a contact list and a means of accessing the presence of contacts. Key Points to Consider: Roster Compositions: The roster consists of contacts explicitly invited by the user. These contacts can be individuals or entities with whom the user interacts frequently. Invitation Mechanism: Users can send invitations by specifying the contact's email address. Upon sending, a visibility request is initiated. If the recipient accepts the request, they are added to the user's roster. To access the roster, you can use the roster property of the Contacts module. This property returns an ArrayItemList containing objects of type IRainbowContact. You can then utilize this interface to display the required information in your application. Below are code examples demonstrating how to implement roster functionality in both Kotlin and Java. kotlin java class RosterFragment : Fragment() { private val rosterChangeListener = IItemListChangeListener { // Handle changes on the UI thread val roster = RainbowSdk().contacts().roster.copyOfDataList } override fun onCreateView(inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?): View { RainbowSdk().contacts().roster.registerChangeListener(rosterChangeListener) return view; } override fun onDestroyView() { RainbowSdk().contacts().roster.unregisterChangeListener(rosterChangeListener) } } public class RosterFragment extends Fragment { private IItemListChangeListener rosterChangeListener = new IItemListChangeListener() { @Override public void dataChanged() { // Handle changes on the UI thread List<IRainbowContact> contacts = RainbowSdk.instance().contacts().getRoster().getCopyOfDataList(); } }; @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) { RainbowSdk.instance().contacts().getRoster().registerChangeListener(rosterChangeListener); return view; } @Override public void onDestroyView() { RainbowSdk.instance().contacts().getRoster().unregisterChangeListener(rosterChangeListener); super.onDestroyView(); } } In a RecyclerView, for example, you can utilize the IRainbowContact interface to display various contact details such as the avatar, first name, last name and company name. This allows you to create a visually appealing and informative user interface for managing contacts within your application. <!-- Sample layout XML for displaying contact details in a RecyclerView --> <androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" android:layout_width=\"match_parent\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" android:minHeight=\"70dp\" xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"> <!-- Avatar and presence indicator --> <com.ale.rainbowx.rainbowavatar.AvatarCardView android:id=\"@+id/avatar\" android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" app:avatarDimension=\"tiny\" app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=\"parent\" app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=\"parent\" app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=\"parent\" android:layout_marginStart=\"@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin\" app:presenceDimension=\"tiny\" app:presencePosition=\"bot"

This guide will walk you through how to handle contact groups in your application, including creating, organizing, and managing groups of Rainbow contacts. Rainbow conceptDescription GroupRepresents a list of Rainbow contacts. Users can create and manage their own contact groups within the app. These groups are private, meaning only the creator can see and use them. Contact within a GroupA Rainbow contact that has been added to a specific group for easier communication or categorization. A contact can belong to multiple groups. Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have completed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials, and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before diving into call log management, ensure the following: Your development environment is set up according to the guidelines provided in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as described in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. With these prerequisites met, you're ready to manage contact groups using the Rainbow SDK for Android. In this guide, we will cover how to create, update, and delete groups, as well as how to add contacts to a group and delete contacts from an existing group. Retrieve user groups The user's contact groups are automatically retrieved when the SDK connects. By default, the first 100 groups are fetched. If this is insufficient for your needs, you can use the fetchGroups() method from the Groups module, which allows you to specify an offset and a limit. RainbowSdk().groups().fetchGroups(offset = 100, limit = 100) // Fetches 100 more groups You can also add a listener to retrieve the data returned by the server. However, it is simpler to listen for changes directly from the RainbowSdk().groups().groups list. private val groupsListener = IItemListChangeListener { RainbowSdk().groups().groups.copyOfDataList // Contains the latest updates to the group list } RainbowSdk().groups().groups.registerChangeListener(groupsListener) // Don't forget to unregister the listener later RainbowSdk().groups().groups.unregisterChangeListener(groupsListener) Retrieve the latest information for a group Groups are kept up to date as long as the connection remains open. If a group is modified on another client, the Android SDK will automatically fetch the latest updates. However, if you wish to manually refresh the data, you can retrieve a group's information by using its ID. RainbowSdk().groups().groups.fetchGroupById(groupId, object : RainbowListener<Group, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: Group) { // Do something with the new data } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle error cases } }) It’s important to note that when retrieving a group or fetching a group by its ID, the Rainbow SDK will resolve the contacts within that group. This resolution can be asynchronous if the contacts are not cached, and once the resolution is complete, the group will be updated. Create a new group A new group can be created using the createGroup() method. A group must have a name between 1 and 255 characters, and it can have an optional description up to 255 characters. Creating a group is a two-step process. First, the group is created by specifying its name. Once the group is retrieved from the server, participants can be added to it. RainbowSdk().groups().createGroup(\"A name\", \"An optional description\", object : RainbowListener<Group, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: Group) { // Now we can add contacts to the group RainbowSdk().groups().addContactsToGroup(data.id, contactIds, object : RainbowListener<Unit, List<RainbowError<Unit>>> { override fun onSuccess(data: Unit) { // Handle success } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<List<RainbowError<Unit>>>) { // Handle error } }) } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle error } }) In this example, once the group is successfully created, the addContactsToGroup() method is called to add participants to the group. Both success and error scenarios are handled in the respective callback methods. Add a contact to a group There is a method for adding a single contact to a group: RainbowSdk().groups().addContactToGroup(groupId, contactId, object : RainbowListener<Unit, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: Unit) { // Handle success } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle error } }) In this example, the addContactToGroup() method is used to add a specific contact (identified by contactId) to a group (identified by groupId). The success and error scenarios are handled in the respective callback methods. Remove contacts from a group Removing contacts follows a similar mechanism to adding them. There are methods for both multiple and single contact removal"

In this guide, we'll take you through the process of accessing the logged-in user's information, allowing you to view or update their details, change their presence status, and even choose a personalized avatar. Rainbow conceptDescription IRainbowContactRepresents the public interface for accessing information about Rainbow contacts, including the logged-in user. This interface is utilized and returned by various SDK functions. RainbowPresenceAn enum providing different states of presence for an IRainbowContact. This includes utility methods for working with presence states. Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have followed the Getting Started and Connecting to Rainbow tutorials, and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before diving into profile management, make sure: Your development environment is set up according to the guidelines in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as explained in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have obtained the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. Now, let's explore the features of profile management with Rainbow SDK for Android Retrieve the connected user You can obtain the instance of the connected user by calling the RainbowSdk().user().getConnectedUser() method. Note: If this method is called before authentication, an empty IRainbowContact object is returned. Once you have the user instance, you can access various properties: kotlin java val user = RainbowSdk().user().getConnectedUser() user.firstName user.lastName user.nickName user.presence user.jobTitle user.getFirstEmailAddress() user.getPhoneNumber(PhoneNumber.PhoneNumberType.HOME) // And so on... IRainbowContact user = RainbowSdk.instance().user().getConnectedUser(); user.getFirstName(); user.getLastName(); user.getNickName(); user.getPresence(); user.getJobTitle(); user.getFirstEmailAddress(); user.getPhoneNumber(PhoneNumber.PhoneNumberType.HOME); // And so on... Get the Last Saved Credentials in Cache You can retrieve the login, password, or token saved in the cache, corresponding to the last credentials used for logging in. This feature is particularly useful for automatic login, allowing you to hide the login screen if the user has previously logged in. kotlin java val login = RainbowSdk().user().userLoginInCache val password = RainbowSdk().user().userPasswordInCache val token = RainbowSdk().user().userTokenInCache String login = RainbowSdk.instance().user().getUserLoginInCache(); String password = RainbowSdk.instance().user().getUserPasswordInCache(); String token = RainbowSdk.instance().user().getUserTokenInCache(); Change Your Presence The user's presence can be manually adjusted to indicate that they are online, absent, busy, etc. Additionally, presence is managed automatically based on factors such as call status and device connections. The different presence states are documented in RainbowPresence. Please note the priority order for applied presence: Presence received from PBX User manually set presence Calendar presence (if Rainbow account is linked to a calendar) Presence during a WebRTC call To manually change the presence, use: kotlin java RainbowSdk().user().setPresenceTo(RainbowPresence.DND) RainbowSdk.instance().user().setPresenceTo(RainbowPresence.DND, null); If you need to be notified of the success or error in changing presence, include a RainbowListener as a parameter. Additionally, you can subscribe to changes in the IRainbowContact object using the IRainbowContact.registerChangeListener method. Provide an IContactListener as a parameter to receive notifications of any presence changes. Listening for changes in the user's presence is defined in section Listen to changes Update Your Personal Information Users have the ability to modify their profile, including fields such as surname, first name, title, emails, telephone number, etc. The update operation utilizes a builder pattern to specify only the fields intended for modification. kotlin java val builder = UpdateUserRequest.Builder() .firstName(\"FirstName\") .lastName(\"LastName\") .nickName(\"NickName\") .title(\"Title\") .jobTitle(\"JobTitle\") .country(\"GBR\") // Country code ISO 3 letters .emailHome(\"email@home.com\") .mobilePhone(PhoneNumber(\"valid_phone_number\", PhoneNumber.PhoneNumberType.MOBILE)) .officePhone(PhoneNumber(\"valid_phone_number\", PhoneNumber.PhoneNumberType.OFFICE)) RainbowSdk().user().updateUser(builder.build(), object : RainbowListener<IRainbowContact, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: IRainbowContact) { // Handle success } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle error } }) UpdateUserRequest builder = new UpdateUserRequest.Builder() .firstName(\"FirstName\") .lastName(\"LastName\") .nickName(\"NickName\") .title(\"Title\") .jobTitle(\"JobTitle\") .coun"

Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have completed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials, and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before proceeding with search management, ensure the following: Your development environment is configured according to the guidelines in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as outlined in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have obtained the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. With these prerequisites in place, let's explore search functionality with Rainbow SDK for Android. How the Search Works To perform a search in Rainbow, you will use the method RainbowSdk().search().search(String, SearchCriteria, ISearchListener). This method accepts three parameters: query: String: The query string you want to execute. searchCriteria: SearchCriteria: A builder object that allows you to configure the search to obtain the desired results. searchListener: ISearchListener<List<Any>>?: A listener that notifies you of success and error cases. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the search, the results are returned as a list of Any. In general, you can search for contacts, conversations, bubbles, contact groups, channels, call groups, and text contained in conversations. These searches can be either local, using data stored in the cache or the device, or server-based via an API request. Depending on what you enable or disable in the builder, the search will perform different queries and return an aggregate of search results. When you call the search() method, a 500ms timer is triggered. Only after this time will the search be executed. If you call the search() method again during this time, the previous query is cancelled. Depending on the number of searches you execute, the API may take some time before returning the list of results. If you wish, you can be notified in real time of each search result as it is added to the list. This allows you to begin displaying results before the API has fully completed. The object RainbowSdk().search().results is an ArrayItemList that allows you to subscribe to updates. This list is cleared with each new search. Key Features of the Search Functionality: Case Insensitivity: Search isn't case-sensitive, so you'll find contacts regardless of capitalization. Accents Insensitivity: Accented characters are treated as equivalent to their non-accented counterparts during the search process. Partial Match: The search accommodates partial matches, enabling efficient retrieval of contacts even with incomplete name inputs (e.g., \"Jo do\" finds \"John Doe\"). Visibility Restrictions: Some users may not be discoverable through search functionalities, particularly if they belong to non-public companies. Default Public Rainbow Company: By default, users are created within the public Rainbow company, making them discoverable through search functionalities. Search for a contact In Rainbow, you can easily find contacts by their names. This search feature isn't limited to just your contact list; it covers all users on the Rainbow platform. The search operation is performed on both the first and last name fields, encompassing all public Rainbow users and users belonging to companies visible to the logged-in user's company. kotlin java val searchCriteria = SearchCriteria.Builder() .setSearchRainbowContacts(true) // Search in roster, user's company, default company .setSearchRainbowContactsByTags(true) // Search not only on the name but also on tags .setSearchLocalContacts(true) // Search on phone contacts list .setSearchPhoneBook(true) // Search in the phone book .build() RainbowSdk().search().search(query = \"Jo Do\", searchCriteria = searchCriteria, object : Search.ISearchListener<List<Any>> { override fun onSearchStarted() { // Indicate that the search has started } override fun onSuccess(data: List<Any>) { // The search completed without errors. The list contains the same data as RainbowSdk().search().results.copyOfDataList } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // The search ended with one or more errors but the list RainbowSdk().search().results.copyOfDataList may still contain results } }) SearchCriteria searchCrit"

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedLTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17Getting Started Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow CSharp SDK (core) ! It's an Assembly library based on CSharp for connecting your application to Rainbow. This assembly is multi-platform: you can use it on Windows, MacOs, Linux but also on Android, iOS and more. Its powerful APIs enable you to create the best application that connect to Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow. This tutorial will help you start with the ALE Rainbow SDK for CSharp (Core) by setting your environment wether you are using Windows, Linux or MacOS. UI Controls according to build quickly / easily an applicatin are provided in others packages specific by platform. But their interface are the same what ever the platform. Prerequisites Assembly in .Net Standard 2.0, .Net Standard 2.1 and .Net 8.0 The SDK is an Assembly targeting .Net Standard 2.0, .Net Standard 2.1 and .Net 8.0 so it can be used in those environments: .NET and .Net Core 2.0+ .NET Framework 4.6.1+ Mono 5.4+ Xamarin.iOS 10.14+ Xamarin.Android 8.0+ Unity 2018.1+ Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299+ More details here Nuget package The SDK is provided as a Nuget package available here Dependencies are all managed by Nuget package system. Development environment You can use: \"Visual Studio for Windows\" - the community edition is free \"Visual Studio for Mac\" \"Visual Studio Code\" - Free for Linux, Mac and Windows If you are using a computer running on MacOS, you can follow this guide to setup your development environment. Setup your Visual Studio project Install \"Rainbow.CSharp.SDK\" as Nuget package In Studio Visual Studio 2019 (or more recent) Use the NuGet Package Manager UI and install the package \"Rainbow.CSharp.SDK\" Initialize the SDK Step 1 : Create a Rainbow application on the developers web site To use the SDK you need an applicationID and a secretKey from the developers website. These information allow you to identify your application and allow you to use the rainbow platform. For more information, see Applications lifecycle which explains what is the purpose, how to create an application and how to get the application ID and the secret key. The hostname is also necessary to know which server is used: the sandbox or the production server Step 2 : Initialize the SDK In your development environment, create an Rainbow.Application object like this: Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); myApp.SetApplicationInfo(applicationID, secretKey); myApp.SetHostInfo(hostname); Where myApp is your application object: with applicationID / secretKey from your Rainbow application created in step 1. with hostname according the server used (`sandbox.openrainbow.com' or 'openrainbow.com') After that you can Connect to Rainbow.

New features will only be available in this version. This guide indicates main tasks to migrate from V2 to V3 and enhancements added in this new version. Simplification Peer objects instead of id, jid and displayName Peer objects are used to describe a Bot, Bubble, CallParticipant, Channel, ConferenceParticipant, Contact, Conversation, MediaService (WebRTC context), DynamicFeed (WebRTC context) or a user known only by a phone number. It means that for any methods using a Peer object as parameter, you can use directly a Bot, Bubble, etc ... thanks to implicit operators. See the Peer documentation for full details. Rainbonw.Application RbApplication; // a valid Rainbonw.Application object Rainbonw.InstantMessaging RbInstantMessaging = RbApplication.GetInstantMessaging() // ... Rainbow.Model.Contact contact; // a valid contact Rainbow.Model.Bubble bubble; // a valid bubble var sdkResult = RbInstantMessaging.SendMessageAsync(contact, \"Hello !\"); sdkResult = RbInstantMessaging.SendMessageAsync(bubble, \"Hello members of the bubble !\"); // => The same method is used SendMessageAsync which accepts a Peer object as first parameter Now methods accept mainly objects instead of string like id or jid to avoid confusion and facilate their uses. From a Peer object, it's possible to get an an object (like a Contact, a Bubble, using the dedicated service): Rainbow.Model.Peer bubble; // a valid bubble Aync/Await pattern Callbacks are no more used but instead async methods are used - For information here: Asynchronous programming with async and await // In V2: bubbles.GetAllBubbles(sdkResult => { if(sdkResult.Result.Success) { List<Bubble> listBubbles = res.Data; //... } else { } } // In V3 var sdkResult = await bubbles.GetAllBubblesAsync(); if( sdkResult.Success ) { List<Bubble> listBubbles = res.Data; // ... } else {} Naming convention nameOfMethod: The method returns a result from its cache - no interaction with the server nameOfMethodAsync: The method is asynchronous and exchanges with the server nameOfMethodSync: The method will exchange with the server if data is not found in cache Event Application.InitializationPerformed has been removed Waiting the end on the login process is enough. var sdkResult = RbApplication.LoginAsync(login, password); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The SDK is connected and ready to use } Data in cache and bubble interactions The SDK manages a lot of data in its cache. Also to interact fully with a Bubble is necessary to be affiliated to it. All this information are described in the guide data_in_cache_and_reconnection Consts and Enums are in specific namespaces All constants values are defined in Rainbow.Consts namespace: Appreciation, Capability, EntityType, PresenceDetails, BubbleMemberPrivilege, PresenceLevel, BubbleMemberStatus, BubbleVisibility, CompanyOfferType, InvitationMode, SupervisionMemberRole,ConferenceType, InvitationStatus, ConnectionStatus, InvitationType, CallState, ... All enums are defined in Rainbow.Enums namespace: MediaSubStreamLevel, SdkErrorType,MessageReceiptType, SdkEventMode,CallStatus, DeviceType, MessageType, SdkInternalErrorEnum,CallType, Media, MessageUrgencyType, SdkMessageStorageMode, ... Delegates instead of EventArgs All events are now using delegates instead of object inherited from EventArgs They are defined in Rainbow.Delegates namespace using a naming convention to quickly understand how to use them. ObjectDelegate means the delegate accept Object as first parameter - for examples: public delegate void BubbleDelegate(Bubble bubble); public delegate void PeerDelegate(Peer bubble); The documentation, for each delegate, list all events using it. Conversations are created automatically When necessary, the SDK will create automatically a Conversaion with the server. It was not the case before. For example, to send a IM to a Peer, a Conversation is necessary. If it doesn't already exist, the SDK will create it before to send the IM. The Conversations service still exists but mostly to know which one is the most recent and/or to use them as a list in a UI. Enhancements Events It's possible to log or not them using: Restrictions.LogEvent (default value) logs events which are raised/triggered by the SDK. Restrictions.LogEventRaised (default value) logs all events raised by SDK even if not bound. Restrictions.LogEventParameters (default value) logs parameters of events which are logged - (up to 20) Restrictions.LogEventStackTrace (default value) logs stack trace of events which are logged Add notion of stackable and unstackable events - both to avoid to trigger several times same event in short period. stackable event: it's triggered only once with all stacked datas - example ContactsAdded event provides a list of contacts unstackable event: it's triggered only once with the final state - example ContactAggregatedPresenceUp"

    "content": "DocumentationEvents, Aysnc/Await and SDKResultLTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17Events, Aysnc/Await and SDKResult object Introduction The SDK is event-based and most methods are asynchronous. An event is a message sent by a service of the SDK to signal the occurrence of an action. For example at any time, the state of the connection with the server can change: no more network connection for example (wifi lost ...). It is therefore necessary to process this type of information at all times. The methods are mainly asynchronous (their names finished by Async) because the SDK must request the server using REST requests, which can take some time. Asynchronous programming with async and await is used - more details here. So you need to know how events and callback worked in C# if you want to understand how to use the SDK. IF you are already familiar with them you don't need to read all this guide but perhaps just the chapter about the SDKResult object. This object (SDKResult object) is used to get results and eventually manage errors. Events Register to events To register to events you have to specify the method which will be used to receive the message raised by the event. This method must have the correct signature according the event used. For example if we focus on AuthenticationFailed, AuthenticationSucceeded and ConnectionStateChanged of the Rainbow.Application object, they are defined like this: public event SdkErrorDelegate AuthenticationFailed; public event VoidDelegate AuthenticationSucceeded; public event ConnectionStateDelegate ConnectionStateChanged; It means that: To register to AuthenticationFailed you need a method which as the same signature than SdkErrorDelegate To register to AuthenticationSucceeded you need a method which as the same signature than VoidDelegate To register to ConnectionStateChanged you need a method which as the same signature than ConnectionStateDelegate They are defined like this: public delegate void SdkErrorDelegate(SdkError sdkError); public delegate void VoidDelegate(); public delegate void ConnectionStateDelegate(ConnectionState connectionState); So to receive these events, we must create a method for each, for example Application_AuthenticationFailed, Application_AuthenticationSucceeded and Application_ConnectionStateChanged private void Application_AuthenticationFailed(SdkError sdkError) // => Same signature than SdkErrorDelegate { // TO DO ... } private void Application_AuthenticationSucceeded() // => Same signature than VoidDelegate { // TO DO ... } private void Application_ConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionState connectionState) // => Same signature than ConnectionStateDelegate { // TO DO ... } Once we have defined these methods, we must indicate that they must be used when these events are triggered like this: // Create Rainbow.Application object Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); // Register to event AuthenticationFailed myApp.AuthenticationFailed += Application_AuthenticationFailed; // => It means we want to receive the event AuthenticationFailed in the method Application_AuthenticationFailed // So the method Application_AuthenticationFailed is called when myApp object needs to trigger this event // Register to event AuthenticationSucceeded myApp.AuthenticationSucceeded += Application_AuthenticationSucceeded; // => It means we want to receive the event AuthenticationSucceeded in the method Application_AuthenticationSucceeded // So the method Application_AuthenticationSucceeded is called when myApp object needs to trigger this event // Register to event ConnectionStateDelegate myApp.ConnectionStateDelegate += Application_ConnectionStateDelegate; // => It means we want to receive the event ConnectionStateDelegate in the method Application_ConnectionStateDelegate // So the method Application_ConnectionStateDelegate is called when myApp object needs to trigger this event Notice in the previous code the use of += to link the event to the method. It means you register to the event. So the full code will be: // Create Rainbow.Application object Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); // Register to event AuthenticationFailed myApp.AuthenticationFailed += Application_AuthenticationFailed; // Register to event AuthenticationSucceeded myApp.AuthenticationSucceeded += Application_AuthenticationSucceeded; // Register to event ConnectionStateDelegate myApp.ConnectionStateDelegate += Application_ConnectionStateDelegate; // Define methods called by events private void Application_AuthenticationFailed(SdkError sdkError) { // TO DO ... } private void Application_AuthenticationSucceeded() { // TO DO ... } private void Application_ConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionState connectionState) { // TO DO ... } It's possible to register several times to the same event using the same method (in this case the method will be called several times) or a different one still using += Unregister to events It's higly recommended to unregister to events if they "

    "content": "DocumentationConnect to RainbowLTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17Connect to Rainbow server Prerequisites To connect to Rainbow Server, you need first to have an applicationID and a secretKey from the developers website. Read first Getting Started if it's not the case. Then you need to have a valid Rainbow account (i.e. a login and a password). You also need to know how events and callback are managed in C# and also know how to use the SdkResult<T> object. If it's not the case read first this guide Events to handle In order to follow correctly the login process, you have to handle several events from the Rainbow.Application object: ConnectionStateChanged: triggered when the connection status has changed (ConnectionStatus.Disconnected, ConnectionStatus.Connecting, ConnectionStatus.Connected) AuthenticationFailed: (Optional) triggered when the authentication has failed - bad login/pwd and/or bad applicationID and a secretKey AuthenticationSucceeded: (Optional) triggered when the authentication has succeeded It is mandatory to wait the event ConnectionStateChanged before to use the SDK with the status ConnectionStatus.Connected because internally the SDK needs to get minimal information from the server to be ready. For example, the SDK needs to get features and settings available for the current user before to be fully operationnal. More details in this advanced guide. Note: events AuthenticationFailed and events AuthenticationSucceeded are optionals. if an error occurred in the login process, the ConnectionStateChanged event contains all necessary information . Another guide explains some details about the AutoReconnection service which wiil try to automatically reconnect to the server in case on network trouble or if the server cannot answer to client requests. Example Find below a basic example to manage correctly the login process in a Console application (working on Windows, Linux and MacOs). Try it with different values for example for login or password with empty / bad values to see how error are managed. using Rainbow; using Rainbow.Consts; String appId = \"\"; // To set according your settings String appSecretKey = \"\"; // To set according your settings String hostName = \"\"; // To set according your settings String login = \"\"; // To set according your settings String password = \"\"; // To set according your settings Boolean endProgram = false;// To know when to quit the app Boolean displayLoginResult = true; // To display login result information only once Object consoleLockObject = new Object(); // To lock until the the current consoly dislay is performed // Create Rainbow SDK objects var RbApplication = new Application(); var RbBubbles = RbApplication.GetBubbles(); var RbContacts = RbApplication.GetContacts(); // Set events that we want to follow RbApplication.AuthenticationFailed += RbApplication_AuthenticationFailed; // Triggered when the authentication process will fail RbApplication.AuthenticationSucceeded += RbApplication_AuthenticationSucceeded; // Triggered when the authentication process will succeed RbApplication.ConnectionStateChanged += RbApplication_ConnectionStateChanged; // Triggered when the Connection State will change // Set global configuration info RbApplication.SetApplicationInfo(appId, appSecretKey); RbApplication.SetHostInfo(hostName); WriteBlue(\"Use [ESC] at anytime to quit\\r\\n\"); // Start login WriteWhite(\"Starting login ...\"); var loginTask = RbApplication.LoginAsync(login, password); // We don't wait here since we want to quit at any time using ESC key do { Thread.Sleep(200); CheckEscKey(); // Check if the login's task is finished AND if we need to display the result (if not already done) if (loginTask.IsCompleted && displayLoginResult) { displayLoginResult = false; // Get SdkResult Object from the task var loginSdkResult = loginTask.Result; if (loginSdkResult.Success) { // We can now use the SDK // For example, we ask Contacts in the Roster var contacts = RbContacts.GetAllContactsInRoster(); WriteYellow($\"Nb Contacts in Roster:[{contacts?.Count}]\"); // We ask all Bubbles known: unsubscribed or not, as invited or as accepted var bubbles = RbBubbles.GetAllBubbles(); WriteYellow($\"Nb bubbles known :[{bubbles?.Count}]\"); } else { endProgram = true; // We want to quit since we cannot login // Display the reason if (loginSdkResult.Result.Type == Rainbow.Enums.SdkErrorType.Exception) WriteRed($\"LoginAsync - Exception occurs: [{loginSdkResult.Result}]\"); else { if (loginSdkResult.Result.IncorrectUseError.ErrorCode == 1000) WriteRed($\"LoginAsync - SDK triggered an error:{loginSdkResult.Result}\"); else WriteRed($\"LoginAsync - Server triggered an error:{loginSdkResult.Result}\"); } } } } while (!endProgram); // Loop until we want to quit #region DEFINE METHODS TO RECEIVE EVENTS FROM RAINBOW SDK // Now we define methods which will be called by events defined previously void RbApplication_ConnectionStateChanged(Rainbow.Model.ConnectionState connectionState) { // We log connection state i"

Features available The AutoReconnection service try to automatically connectec/reconnect to the server in case of disconnection. This service is always started as soon as a login method in Application service is used. This service is stopped / cancelled: if AutoReconnection.Cancel() method is used if the current user uses Application.LogoutAsync() method if the maximum number of attempts is reached. if the user token has expired and AutoReconnection.UsePreviousLoginPwd property is set to False. if an attempt (using token or user credentails) is not accepted by the server: inappropriate token or if this user has no more the right to access to the server (account disabled or deleted for example) When the service is stopped / cancelled, the AutoReconnection.Cancelled event is triggered. If AutoReconnection.CheckNetworkInterfaces property is set to True (default value), an attempt is performed by this service only: if at least one network interface has its status set as Up (enabled and with an ip address). of if no interfarce is Up, cheack at least one networkt interface has its status set as Unknown (for compatibility purpose with some device running with old frameworks) Once connected again, the number of attempt is set to zero. If the maximum number of attempt is reached, the service is stopped and the AutoReconnection.MaxNbAttemptsReached event is triggered too. Each attempt uses first the user token to connect to the server if available and if it's not expired. This service ensures to renew the current user token on its half-life. If it's no more possible to renew it, the AutoReconnection.TokenExpired event is triggered and the connection to the server is automatically stopped. In this case, if AutoReconnection.UsePreviousLoginPwd was set to False, the service is also stopped. If it was set to True, the service try to use previous credentials to connect to the server. Default values: AutoReconnection.MaxNbAttempts = 50 AutoReconnection.DelayBetweenAttempts = { 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, ... } (in ms, not necessary to specify all values, last one is used for all others attempts AutoReconnection.MaxRandomDelayBetwenAttemps = { 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, ... } (in ms, not necessary to specify all values, last one is used for all others attempts AutoReconnection.AvoidNetworkInterfaceKeywordsInDescription = null (so all network interface are taken into consideration by default) IMPORTANT NOTE: The default values have been chosen to be as relevant as possible in the majority of cases If for any reason the Rainbow server is in a congestion phase, this service will take this into account and, accordingly, automatically a specific delay between retries will be used. Code example This code is based on the one available in the guide Connect to Rainbow. Management of events from AutoReconnection service have been added. It's interesseting to see what is happening if you start it and try to disable all your network connections. Also try to change defaults values of this service, for example with a little value for AutoReconnection.MaxNbAttempts Once you have well understood the use of this servicen, read this advanced guide to understand how the SDK stores data in its cache and how they are synchronized after connection/reconnection. using Rainbow; using Rainbow.Consts; String appId = \"\"; // To set according your settings String appSecretKey = \"\"; // To set according your settings String hostName = \"\"; // To set according your settings String login = \"\"; // To set according your settings String password = \"\"; // To set according your settings Boolean endProgram = false;// To know when to quit the app Boolean displayLoginResult = true; // To display login result information only once Object consoleLockObject = new Object(); // To lock until the the current consoly dislay is performed // Create Rainbow SDK objects var RbApplication = new Application(); var RbAutoReconnection = RbApplication.GetAutoReconnection(); var RbBubbles = RbApplication.GetBubbles(); var RbContacts = RbApplication.GetContacts(); // Set events that we want to follow RbApplication.AuthenticationFailed += RbApplication_AuthenticationFailed; // Triggered when the authentication process will fail RbApplication.AuthenticationSucceeded += RbApplication_AuthenticationSucceeded; // Triggered when the authentication process will succeed RbApplication.ConnectionStateChanged += RbApplication_ConnectionStateChanged; // Triggered when the Connection State will change RbAutoReconnection.Cancelled += RbAutoReconnection_Cancelled; // Triggered when AutoReonnection service is cancelled RbAutoReconnection.Started += RbAutoReconnection_Started; // Triggered when AutoReonnection service is started RbAutoReconnection.MaxNbAttemptsReached += RbAut"

    "content": "DocumentationXMPP, S2S and WebhookLTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17XMPP, S2S (Server to server) and Webhook This guide describes how to select an event mode (XMPP, S2S and even no event) and how they are working (architecture, code snippet). It also describes the possibility of using webhooks in addition. Event mode By default, the CSharp SDK uses XMPP to handle events from server using a Web socket. It's also possible to receive events using S2S (Server to Server). You can also choose to use no event mode. Events permis to know (for example) when a message has been received, when someone has added you in a bubble, when someone chnaged his presence (online, busy, ...), etc ... This event are linked to the user connected with the SDK. The CSharp SDK allows you, almost transparently, to use one of these event modes without the need for specific code. Only some events and methods are not available/allowed in S2S event mode (Cf. Events and Methods available). Select an event mode To select a specific event mode, you only need to set if before the login to the Rainbow Server using EventMode property from Restrictions object accessible in Rainbow.Application. By default, the event mode selected is XMPP. If you choose S2S event mode, you also need to specify a callback URL. See next chapter to understand the architecture involved in S2S and why/how the callback URL is used. String callbackUrl = \"https://myWebServer.com/callbackPath\"; Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); // To set S2S as event mode myApp.Restrictions.EventMode = Restrictions.SDKEventMode.S2S; // Need to specify in S2S event mode the Callback URL used to receive events myApp.SetS2SCallbackUrl(callbackUrl); // To set no event mode myApp.Restrictions.EventMode = Restrictions.SDKEventMode.NONE; // To set XMPP as event mode (it's the default mode) myApp.Restrictions.EventMode = Restrictions.SDKEventMode.XMPP; // Now we can specify the Application ID, the Secret Key and the hostnam to use like always myApp.SetApplicationInfo(applicationID, secretKey); myApp.SetHostInfo(hostname); // And finally start the login var loginTask = myApp.LoginAsync(login, password); Event mode and architecture When XMPP Event mode is used, a WebSocket is created between the SDK and the Rainbow cloud server to receive events from server but also to send data for IM and Presence features. REST API is also used to get data from Server S2S event mode and architecture When S2S Event mode is used, there is no web socket but a callback URL is used to received events from Server. REST API is used to get data from Server and also to manage IM and Presence features. So if you want to handle a lot of messages you can scale your architecture using a load balancer. S2S event mode - handle events from Rainbow server In XMPP event mode, you have nothing to do to deal with incoming data from the web socket. They are automatically parsed internally and according the result an event is raised by the SDK. In S2S event mode, it's a little different. It's up to you to configure your web server, set the correct callbackURL and give to SDK the content of data received on it. Your web server will receive data with a specific HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, etc...) with a specific absolute path (for example mypath based on the previous screenshoot since the callback URL used is https://my.server.domain/mypath) with a specific content (JSON content) with a content type You must check that the content type is equal to application/json. For the 3 other data, you don't have to analyse / parse, you just need to provide them to the SDK - then it will parse the information, and, like in XMPP mode, according the result, an event is raised by the SDK. To do this you have to use the method ParseCallbackContent of the S2SEventPipe object. This method returns a boolean to indicate if the parsing has been done correctly or not. Your web server must always return an HTTP 200 Ok answer even if the parsing hhs not been done correclty. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.S2SEventPipe s2sEventPipe = Rainbow.S2SEventPipe.Instance; ... // You specify a valid S2S callbackURL to your Rainbow.Appliaction object myApp.SetS2SCallbackUrl(exeSettings.S2SCallbackURL); // You set correctly AppdId, AppSecret, HostName and a valid account (login + pwd) using your Rainbow.Appliaction object // You start the login ... ... // Your Web server is receiving data from the Rainbow Server protected override async Task OnRequestAsync(IHttpContext context) { // We get the HTTP verb of the request (POST, GET, ...) String httpVerb = context.Request.HttpVerb.ToString(); // We get the AbsolutePath of the request String absolutePath = context.Request.Url.AbsolutePath; // We get the body of the request String body = await context.GetRequestBodyAsStringAsync(); // And finnaly we need the content-type of the body String? contentType = context.Request.Headers[\"Content-Type\"]; // We use Rainbow.S2SEventPipe "

So according your needs, the way to use the SDK is different. Perhaps in Bot context: you don't want / have to store messages sent by it you don't need to use an event pipe because you have to perform only administration tasks Also if you are in a degugging phase, you want to log more details. The Restrictions object from Application service is designed to tune the SDK according your needs. The more restrictions you set, the more effective the SDK will be. Below you will find details about most common properties. Read documentation of Restrictions object to have the full list. How to set Restrictions To set restrictions, you have to set properties in the Restrictions object. This must be done before to start the login process. Code example: // Create Rainbow Application object Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); // Get Restrictions object var myRestrictions = myApp.Restrictions; // Now we can set restrictions according your needs // To use WebRTC features - False by default myApp.Restrictions.UseWebRTC = true; // To send automatically a read receipt when a message is recevied - False by default myApp.Restrictions.SendReadReceipt = true; // etc ... Limit the use of some services If you don't need to use some features/services (even if you have the licence), it's better to indicate if to the SDK. UseBubbles property (True by default) to use Bubbles or not. UseConferences property (True by default) to use Conferences or not. UseHubTelephony property (True by default) to use Hybrid Telephony or not. UseHybridTelephony property (True by default) to use Hybrid Telephony or not. UseWebRTC property (False by default) to use WebRTC or not. UseAlerts property (False by default) to use Alerts message service or not. NOTE: Alert messages service needs a specific licence Alert messages service is not related to IM messages and MessageUrgencyType set as MessageUrgencyType.High (i.e. Urgent message) For more details read documentation of Rainbow.Alerts service. Event mode restriction Like described in details in another guide (Cf. XMPP or Server to Server events mode) you can select the event mode restriction between XMPP or S2S. You have to set EventMode property according your needs. SdkEventMode.XMPP is used by default. Logging options You have the possibility to have more or less logs according some options. Logs about events: LogEvent if set to True (default value) to log all events which are raised/triggered by the SDK. LogEventRaised if set to True (default value) to log all events which should be raised/triggered or not by the SDK. LogEventParameters if set to True (default value) to log parameters of events which are raised/triggered by the SDK - LogEvent or LogEventRaised must be also true. LogEventStackTrace if set to True (default value) to log stack trace of events which are raised/triggered by the SDK - LogEvent or LogEventRaised must be also true. Logs about REST requests: LogRestRequest if set to True (False by default) to log all REST requests (with or without servers error). LogRestRequestOnError if set to True (default value) to log all REST requests with servers error. Logs about Bubbles: LogBubbleMembers if set to True (False by default) to log also Members when a Bubble is loggued. NOTE: It's possible to have anonymous log (default) or not using Util.SetLogAnonymously() Allow to send message to the current connected user of the SDK In a BOT context, perhaps you want to send messages to the current connected user of the SDK. For this use LogRestRequestOnError property. Automatically send a read receipt In a BOT context, perhaps you want to automatically send a read receipt for each message received. For this use SendReadReceipt property. Mobile application If the SDK is used to create Mobile Application, it's mandatory to set MobileApplication property to True. It ensures to share a correct presence level to other user devices as a Mobile Application.

Auto Reconnection. Introduction This guide will explain: How to get and update information of the current contact (the one connected to the server) How to get and update his avatar How to get and change his presence How to get login/password from the INI file How to know when the password has been changed even from another device At then end of this guide, a full example is available (a console application working on Windows, Linux and MacOs) Get/Update information of the current contact Once connected, you can get a Contact object using GetCurrentContact() method from Contacts service. This objects contains several properties FirstName LastName NickName etc ... You just have to update some of them and use UpdateCurrentContactAsync() method to ask Rainbow server to do it. Code snippet: (full example at the end of the guide) var RbApplication = new Application(iniFileFolder, iniFileName); var RbContacts = RbApplication.GetContacts(); Contact? currentContact = null; ... // Once connected // Get current contact currentContact = RbContacts.GetCurrentContact(); // Get Firt Name var firstName = myContact.FirstName; // We want to update the first name currentContact.FirstName = currentContact.FirstName + \" - Update using SDK C#\"; var contactSdkResult = await RbContacts.UpdateCurrentContactAsync(currentContact); if (contactSdkResult.Success) { // Operation done successfully } else { // Error to manage } Get/Update Avatar of the current contact Once connected you can get the Avatar (if any) in PNG format of the current contact using GetAvatarAsync() method. You can update it using byte array from a valid JPG, JPEG or PNG file using UpdateAvatarAsync() method. And delete it using DeleteAvatarAsync() method. Code snippet: (full example at the end of the guide) var RbApplication = new Application(iniFileFolder, iniFileName); var RbContacts = RbApplication.GetContacts(); Contact? currentContact = null; ... // Once connected // Get current contact currentContact = RbContacts.GetCurrentContact(); // Get avatar (if any) of the current contact var avatarSdkResult = await RbContacts.GetAvatarAsync(); // We wait here the result from server if(avatarSdkResult.Success) { // Get Avatar as byte[] var avatar = avatarSdkResult.Data; // Get current directory to save this avatar using Id of the current cotnact var avatarPath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), currentContact.Peer.Id + \".png\"); try { File.WriteAllBytes(avatarPath, avatar); } catch(Exception exc) { } } else { // Error to manage } // Update Avatar String avatarFilePath = @\"C:\\media\\Avatar\\avatar_02.png\"; // Set a valid Path to an image file (PNG, JPG or JPEG) if(File.Exists(avatarFilePath)) { var bytes = File.ReadAllBytes(avatarFilePath); var booleanSdkResult = await RbContacts.UpdateAvatarAsync(bytes, \"JPG\"); if (booleanSdkResult.Success) { // Avatar has been updated } else // Error to manage } // Delete Avatar var booleanSdkResult = await RbContacts.DeleteAvatarAsync(); if (booleanSdkResult.Success) { // Avatar has been deleted } else // Error to manage Get/Change presence of the current contact You can change your Rainbow presence by calling SetPresenceLevelAsync() method or SetBusyPresenceAccordingMediasAsync() method. Presence object contains properties PresenceLevel and PresenceDetails Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.Contacts contacts = myApp.GetContacts(); ... // Once connected / initialized contacts.SetBusyPresenceAccordingMediasAsync(Call.Media.AUDIO); ... contacts.SetBusyPresenceAccordingMediasAsync(Call.Media.VIDEO); ... contacts.SetPresenceLevelAsync(contacts.CreatePresence(true, PresenceLevel.Online)); ... contacts.SetPresenceLevelAsync(contacts.CreatePresence(true, PresenceLevel.Dnd)); Listen if the user password has been changed To do it, you should listen to event PasswordUpdated from Application class. When this event is fired it's mandatory to logout and to login to continue to use the Rainbow service Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); ... myApp.PasswordUpdated += MyApp_PasswordUpdated; ... private void MyApp_PasswordUpdated() { // The current contact password has been changed ... // Need to logout and to login again with new credentials } Get the last credentials saved in cache You can retrieve the login and password saved in cache.

It's not necessary to have admin rights to use this method Differences between standard User and GuestMode To know if a Contact is a GuestMode, check GuestMode property of a Contact A GuestMode can be created without admin rights using Administration.CreateUserWithBubbleLinkAsync() GuestMode restrictions: it has been created thanks to a Bubble Link - so it's related to a bubble it will be disabled / removed: when the conference of this bubble is finished and if it has joined it or after 48 hours it can't have a network / roster: No user can be added to the guest's network (subject to change). it can’t be added to a user's network. it can’t do search (subject to change). it can’t create a bubble, a channel or a group (can be added into bubbles, channels or groups). it can't be associated to Hybrid or Hub devices it CAN post a file (can receive files). it CAN participate to the conference related to this bubble it CAN be found by search Company Link According its rights, an admin account can create Company Link. You have to use the Administration service. You have these methods: CreateJoinCompanyLinkAsync(), DeleteJoinCompanyLinkAsync() GetJoinCompanyLinksAsync() GetDomainNameFromBubbleLink() If you don't have the right to manage Company Link, an error will be raised by the server. Once you have a valid Company Link, you can create users without admin rights using Administration.CreateUserWithCompanyLinkAsync(). Bubble Link Any user who is Owner or Moderator of a Bubble can manage Bubble Link. You have to use the Bubbles service. You have these methods: CreateBubbleLinkAsync(), RemoveBubbleLinkAsync(), GenerateNewBubbleLinkAsync() GetBubbleLinkAsync() CheckBubbleLinkValidityAsync() JoinByBubbleLinkAsync() - to join a bubble if you have it's Bubble Link Once you have a valid Bubble Link, you can create GuestMode without admin rights using Administration.CreateUserWithBubbleLinkAsync() Examples You can take a look to several examples available here On this pageManaging Users and GuestsOrganisationCompanyCreate User and GuestModeDifferences between standard User and GuestModeCompany LinkBubble LinkExamplesWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

It's based on a full example available here Retrieving active conversations To retrieve all active conversations, you can use the GetAllConversations method of Conversations object. They are sorted by date, for the conversation the most recent (i.e. the last one where a message has been exchanged) to the older. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); ... Rainbow.Conversations conversations = myApp.GetConversations(); Rainbow.Contacts contacts = myApp.GetConversations(); Rainbow.Bubbles bubbles = myApp.GetConversations(); List<Conversation> list = RbConversations.GetAllConversations(); foreach(var conversation in list) { // Is it a conversation in a Bubble's context ? if (conversation.Peer.Type == EntityType.Bubble) { // Get Bubble object from Peer object var bubble = bubbles.GetBubble(conversation.Peer); } else { // Get Contact object from Peer object var contact = contacts.GetContact(conversation.Peer); } } Remove a conversation To remove a conversation, you can call RemoveFromConversationsAsync method from Conversations object. The conversation is removed from the conversations list but messages already exchanged in it are not deleted. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); ... Rainbow.Conversations conversations = myApp.GetConversations(); ... Rainbow.Conversation conversation; // Your conversation var sdkResult = await conversations.RemoveFromConversationsAsync(conversation); if (sdkResult.Success) { var lastConversationDeleted = sdkResult.Data; Util.WriteDarkYellow($\"{CR}Conversation deleted:[{lastConversationDeleted.ToString(DetailsLevel.Medium)}]\"); } else { // Display the reason if (sdkResult.Result.Type == Rainbow.Enums.SdkErrorType.Exception) Util.WriteRed($\"RemoveFromConversationsAsync - Exception occurs: [{sdkResult.Result}]\"); else { if (sdkResult.Result.IncorrectUseError.ErrorCode == 1000) WriteRed($\"LoginAsync - SDK triggered an error:{sdkResult.Result}\"); else WriteRed($\"LoginAsync - Server triggered an error:{sdkResult.Result}\"); } } Get older messages exchanged with a Peer To get older messages exchanged with a Peer, the GetOlderMessagesAsync method of InstantMessaging object must be used. This method asks the server to get older messages with a Peer and add them in the cache of the SDK. If you call again this method, older messages from previous result are retrieved until there is no more message. For performance reason, it's not possible to get all messages in one call. You need to call several times GetOlderMessagesAsync until you received no more messages. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); ... Rainbow.InstantMessaging instantMessaging = myApp.GetInstantMessaging(); ... Rainbow.Model.Contact contact; Rainbow.Model.Bubble Bubble; int nbMessages = 20; // Nb message to retrieve Rainbow.Model.Peer peer = contact; // We use here a Peer as Contact // peer = bubble; // => It's also possible to use a Peer as Bubble var sdkResult = await RbInstantMessaging.GetOlderMessagesAsync(peer, 5); if(sdkResult.Success) { var messages = sdkResult.Data; if (messages.Count > 0) { StringBuilder stringBuilder = new(); int index = 0; foreach (var message in messages) { stringBuilder.Append($\"{CR}Message [{index++:00}]:\"); AppendMessage(ref stringBuilder, message, $\"{CR}\\t\"); } Util.WriteDarkYellow($\"{CR}Older messages with Peer:[{peer.ToString(DetailsLevel.Small)}]:\"); Util.WriteDarkYellow($\"{CR}{stringBuilder}\"); } else Util.WriteDarkYellow($\"{CR}No more older messages to retrieve with Peer:[{peer.ToString(DetailsLevel.Small)}]:\"); } else { // Display the reason if (sdkResult.Result.Type == Rainbow.Enums.SdkErrorType.Exception) Util.WriteRed($\"GetOlderMessagesAsync - Exception occurs: [{sdkResult.Result}]\"); else { if (sdkResult.Result.IncorrectUseError.ErrorCode == 1000) WriteRed($\"GetOlderMessagesAsync - SDK triggered an error:{sdkResult.Result}\"); else WriteRed($\"GetOlderMessagesAsync - Server triggered an error:{sdkResult.Result}\"); } } Get messages already exchanged with Contacts / Bubbles To get messages already exchanged with Contacts / Bubbles, use GetOlderMessages method of InstantMessaging object. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); ... Rainbow.InstantMessaging instantMessaging = myApp.GetInstantMessaging(); ...

It's based on a full example available here Roster The Roster is the list of contacts who share their presence with the current contact. It's not possible to get presence of a contact which is not your Roster. To get the list of contacts in you Roster, you need to use the Contacts service and use GetAllContactsInRoster method. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); ... Rainbow.Contacts contacts = myApp.GetContacts(); ... // You need to log first on the server ... var list = RbContacts.GetAllContactsInRoster(); if(list.Count > 0) { Util.WriteDarkYellow($\"{CR}Nb Contacts in your roster:[{list.Count}]\"); } Note: When you have a Contact object, it's easy to know if it's in your Roster using the property InRoster. Get Contact Presence by devices It's possible to get Contact Presence using GetPresencesList(Peer peer), GetPresencesList(string contactJid) or GetPresencesListAsync(Peer peer) of Contacts service. These methods returns a Dictionary of Presence object and not just one Presence object since a Contact can be connected to the Rainbow server using one or several devices. The Dictionary is indexed using the resource ID of each devices using by this contact. This Dictionary is useful if you want to know specifically the contact presence for a specific device. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.Contacts contacts = myApp.GetContacts(); ... Rainbow.Model.Contact contact; // A Contact in the Roster // You need to log first on the server ... Dictionary<String, Presence> presences = RbContacts.GetPresencesList(contact); // Loop on each Presence object in the Dictionary foreach (Presence presence in presences.Values) { // presence.Contact => Contact's related to this presence // presence.Apply => True, if this presence must be used to build the aggregated presence. // presence.Date => The Date when the presence has been set // presence.PresenceDetails / presence.PresenceLevel => The IM Presence // presence.PresencePhoneState => The presence state of the phone (if any) // presence.Resource => Resource Id specific of the contact device used // presence.Until => in UTC format - The validity date until this presence is valid (if not equals to DateTime.MinValue). For calendar presence, if date is passed, it means that the user is \"available\" from a calendra presence point of view } Get Aggregated Presence If you don't need to know the Contact Presence by Device but just a summary, use the aggregated Presence information. For this, use one of these methods GetAggregatedPresence(Peer peer) of Contacts service. Only one Presence object is returned is this case. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.Contacts contacts = myApp.GetContacts(); ... Rainbow.Model.Contact contact; // A Contact in the Roster // You need to log on the server ... Presence presence = contacts.GetAggregatedPresence(contact); // presence.Contact => Contact's related to this presence // presence.Apply => True, if this presence must be used to build the aggregated presence. // presence.Date => The Date when the presence has been set // presence.PresenceDetails / presence.PresenceLevel => The IM Presence // presence.PresencePhoneState => The presence state of the phone (if any) // presence.Resource => Resource Id specific of the contact device used // presence.Until => in UTC format - The validity date until this presence is valid (if not equals to DateTime.MinValue). For calendar presence, if date is passed, it means that the user is \"available\" from a calendra presence point of view } Manage events related to presence To be informed of Contact Presence update, you need to manage these events ContactPresenceUpdated, ContactAggregatedPresenceUpdated of Contacts service. ContactPresenceUpdated is raised when the presence of a Contact is changed on one of its device. It's useful only if you want to know Contact Presence by device. ContactAggregatedPresenceUpdated is raised when the aggregated presence of a Contact is changed. It's useful only if you want to know the update of the Contact Presence summary. So it's possible to have the event ContactPresenceUpdated raised several times but not the event ContactAggregatedPresenceUpdated. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.Contacts contacts = myApp.GetContacts(); ... // We want to be informed of Contact Presence update by device contacts.ContactPresenceUpdated += Contacts_ContactPresenceUpdated; // We want to be informed of Contact Presence summary update contacts.ContactAggregatedPresenceUpdated += Contacts_ContactAggregatedPresenceUpdated; // Handle Contact Presence update by device private void Contacts_ContactPresenceUpdated(Rainbow.Model.Presence presence) { // presence.Contact => Contact's related to this prese"

To manage them you need to have the global Bubbles service from the Application object using GetBubbles method. Get list of existing bubbles Once you have the global Bubbles service, you have the list of existings bubbles using GetAllBubbles. You can use the PeerOwner property to know if the current user if the creator of this Bubble or just a member. Only bubbles where you are a member (as moderator or as simple member) are returned - even if you are still in Bubble.MemberStatus set as Bubble.MemberStatus.Invited Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.Bubbles bubbles = myApp.GetBubbles(); Rainbow.Contacts contacts = myApp.GetContacts(); ... // Once connected Contact myContact = contacts.GetCurrentContact(); ... var myContact = RbContacts.GetCurrentContact(); List<Bubble> listBubbles = RbBubbles.GetAllBubbles(); foreach (Bubble bubble in listBubbles) { if(bubble.PeerOwner.Id == myContact.Peer.Id) { // You are the owner of this bubble } } Get list of bubble's member To know the list of members, you can use the Users property of Bubble object. Each member has a Bubble.MemberStatus property (Invited, Accepted or Unsubscribed) and a Bubble.MemberPrivilege property ( Guest, User, Moderator or Owner). // Once connected Rainbow.Bubble bubble; // A bubble previously found / set ... // Loop on each member foreach (var member in bubble.Users.Values.ToList()) { if (member.Status == BubbleMemberStatus.Accepted) { // This member has accepted to be a member of this bubble } if (member.Privilege == BubbleMemberPrivilege.Owner) { // This member is the owner of this bubble } } Add a member to a bubble To add a member to a bubble you can use AddMemberAsync(Peer bubbleAsPeer, Peer contactToAddAsPeer, BubbleMemberPrivilege privilege) method from Bubbles service. An invitation is sent to him. It has its BubbleMemberStatus set to Invited until it accept or reject the invitation. You can add a member only if you are Owner or Moderator of this Bubble. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.Bubbles bubbles = myApp.GetBubbles(); ... // Once connected Rainbow.Model.Bubble bubble; // A bubble previously found / set Rainbow.Model.Contact contact; // A contact previously found / set BubbleMemberPrivilege privilege = BubbleMemberPrivilege.Member // We provide member privilege to this contact // privilege = BubbleMemberPrivilege.Moderator // => If we want to add this member as Moderator ... var sdkResult = RbBubbles.AddMemberAsync(bubble, contact, privilege); if (!sdkResult.Success) { if (sdkResult.Result.IncorrectUseError != null) { // Incorrect use Util.WriteRed($\"AddMemberAsync - SdkError:[{sdkResult.Result}]\"); } else { // Pb with the server Util.WriteRed($\"AddMemberAsync - SdkError:[{sdkResult.Result}]\"); } } It's also possible to add a member to a bubble without sending an invitation and waitin it's apprabation using the parameter isDirectlyAccepted and set it to True Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.Bubbles bubbles = myApp.GetBubbles(); ... // Once connected Rainbow.Model.Bubble bubble; // A bubble previously found / set Rainbow.Model.Contact contact; // A contact previously found / set BubbleMemberPrivilege privilege = BubbleMemberPrivilege.Member // We provide member privilege to this contact // privilege = BubbleMemberPrivilege.Moderator // => If we want to add this member as Moderator ... var sdkResult = RbBubbles.AddMemberAsync(bubble, contact, privilege, isDirectlyAccepted: true); if (!sdkResult.Success) { if (sdkResult.Result.IncorrectUseError != null) { // Incorrect use Util.WriteRed($\"AddMemberAsync - SdkError:[{sdkResult.Result}]\"); } else { // Pb with the server Util.WriteRed($\"AddMemberAsync - SdkError:[{sdkResult.Result}]\"); } } Remove a member from a bubble To remove a member from a bubble you can use RemoveMemberAsync(Peer bubbleAsPeer, Peer contactToRemoveAsPeer) method from Bubbles service. The effect is immediat. You can remove a member only if you are Owner or Moderator of this Bubble.

    "content": "DocumentationManaging filesLTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17Managing files This guide explains how to manage files: how to share a file, delete, get the list and the quota usage. A FileDescriptor object is used to describe a file shared with Rainbow server: Id Name Type (image, voiceMessage, conversationRecording or other) Size etc ... List of all (received, sent or both) files You need first the FileStorage service from Application using GetFileStorage() method. To get the list of all received files (i.e. the list of all files that the SDK user as received in all conversations: Bubbles, Peer To Peer, ...) you use GetAllFileDescriptorsReceivedAsync from FileStorage service. To get the list of all sent files (i.e. the list of all files that the SDK user as sent in all conversations: Bubbles, Peer To Peer, ...) you use GetAllFileDescriptorsSentAsync from FileStorage service. To get the list of all files (received and sent) then you use GetAllFileDescriptorsAsync from FileStorage service. To know where this file has been shared use the property Viewers of the FileDescriptor object. Below it's an example using GetAllFileDescriptorsReceivedAsync (it will be nearly exactly the same using GetAllFileDescriptorsSentAsync or GetAllFileDescriptorsAsync ) Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.Bubbles RbBubbles = RbApplication.GetBubbles(); Rainbow.Contacts RbContacts = RbApplication.GetContacts(); Rainbow.FileStorage RbFileStorage = myApp.GetFileStorage(); ... // Here we consider to be connected / initialized with the server var RbChannels = RbApplication.GetChannels(); var sdkResult = await RbFileStorage.GetAllFileDescriptorsAsync(); if (sdkResult.Success) { List<FileDescriptor> list = sdkResult.Data; foreach (FileDescriptor fileDescriptor in list) { String id = fileDescriptor.Id; // Id of the file String name = fileDescriptor.FileName; // Name of the file long size = fileDescriptor.Size; // Size of the file // Check where this file has been shared List<FileViewer> viewers = fileDescriptor.Viewers; foreach (FileViewer viewer in viewers) { switch (viewer.Type) { case EntityType.User: // Get related contact var contact = RbContacts.GetContactById(viewer.ViewerId); break; case EntityType.Bubble: // Get related bubble var bubble = RbBubbles.GetBubbleById(viewer.ViewerId); break; case EntityType.Channel: // Get related channel var channel = RbChannels.GetChannelById(viewer.ViewerId); break; } } } } List of files (received, sent or both) by conversation Generally, it's better to to get the list of files (received, sent or both) with a specific Peer. To do this you can use GetFileDescriptorsAsync(Peer peer), GetFileDescriptorsReceivedAsync(Peer peer) or GetFileDescriptorsSentAsync(Peer peer) methods from FileStorage service. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.FileStorage fileStorage = myApp.GetFileStorage(); ... // Once connected Rainbow.Peer peer; // A Peer previously set / retrieved (from Contact, Bubbles or Channels) var sdkResult = await RbFileStorage.GetFileDescriptorsSentAsync(peer); if(sdkResult.Success) { // Get the list of sent files with this Peer List<FileDescriptor> fileDescriptorList = sdkResult.Data; // ... } var sdkResult = await RbFileStorage.GetFileDescriptorsReceivedAsync(peer); if(sdkResult.Success) { // Get the list of received files from this Peer List<FileDescriptor> fileDescriptorList = sdkResult.Data; // ... } var sdkResult = await RbFileStorage.GetFileDescriptorsAsync(peer); if(sdkResult.Success) { // Get the list of received / sent files with this Peer List<FileDescriptor> fileDescriptorList = sdkResult.Data; // ... } FileStorageUpdated Event The FileStorageUpdated event from FileStorage service permits to know when a file has been added, deleted or updated for the current user (so when a remote Peer has added/removed a file in a Bubble or in Channel or sent/remove a file with the current user) Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.FileStorage RbFileStorage = RbApplication.GetFileStorage(); // ... RbFileStorage.FileStorageUpdated += RbFileStorage_FileStorageUpdated; void RbFileStorage_FileStorageUpdated(List<FileDescriptor> filesDescriptor, string status) { // status: Status of the file (create, delete, update) described in filesDescriptor // filesDescriptor: list of FileDescriptor which have been updated (cf. status) in the FileStorage } How to share/upload a file using IM To share a file with a Peer (as Contact or Bubble), the best is to send to it a instant message with a file. So it can see it in the conversation stream and receive an IM notification. To do this, the SendMessageWithFileAsync method can be used from InstantMessaging service. This method has fileDescriptorProgressDelegate optional parameter which permits to follow the upload file progress - cf. next chapter for more details. The larger the shared file, the longer the delay to send the message. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); R"

Manage conference recording Manage your own media Most of the information can only be obtained if the user using the SDK actually participates in the conference - either by using another device (via any UCaaS application), or by using an SDK that allows connection via WebRTC to the conference (for example, using the C# SDK and the Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Desktop package). Check permissions First thing to do, it's to check if the user can make conferences. For this IsConferenceAllowed() method must be used from Conferences service. Check conference status To follow the status of conference in progress use: ConferenceUpdated event when a conference information is updated (so the conference is in progress / has started) ConferenceRemoved event when a conference is removed/finished ConferenceRejected event when a conference has been rejected by the current user` object (same event for PSTN or WebRTC conference). You have also this methods: CheckConferencesInProgressAsync(): The result permits to know if there as least one conference in progress. GetAllConferences(): To get conferences list in progress from the cache GetFullSnapshotAsync() or GetSnapshotAsync() using a bubble peer to know (if any) conference information Get the list of participants and talkers You have event to get those information: ConferenceParticipantsUpdated event when at least one participant has been added, removed, updated ConferenceTalkersUpdated event when at least one telker has been added, removed, updated But also methods: GetParticipants() GetTalkers() Mute/unmute a participant, raise hand, lower hand, or all hands Use MuteOrUnmuteParticipantAsync() to mute / unmute a participant. You must be a conference moderator if you wish to manage this for a participant other than yourself. Use RaiseHandAsync(), LowerHandAsync() to raise / lower hand. You must be a conference moderator if you wish to manage this for a participant other than yourself. Use LowerAllHandsAsync() to lower all hands as moderator. Remove a participant As moderator, use DropParticipantAsync to remove a participant from the conference. List the media used and the people who used them. You have event to get those information: ConferenceMediaPublicationsUpdated event when at least one Media Publication has been added, removed, updated ConferenceMediaServicesUpdated event when at least one Media Service has been added, removed, updated ConferenceMediaPublicationSubscribersUpdated event when at least one Subscriber to a Media Publication has been added, removed, updated But also methods: GetMediaPublications() GetMediaServices() GetMediaPublications() GetMediaPublications() Manage conference recording To know the conference recording status use the ConferenceUpdated event. The propety RecordStatus of Conference object permits to know if the conference is recorded - status possible are off/on/pause. As moderator, you can use this methods: StartRecordingAsync() StopRecordingAsync() PauseRecordingAsync() ResumeRecordingAsync() Manage your own media This chapter describes events / methods only useful if you are connecting to the conference using WebRTC (for example, using Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Desktop package) To be more precise, this methods are used by these package to handle medias: AddAudioAsync(): To add audio in a conference if this media was not already used by the current user SubscribeToMediaPublicationAsync(): gives the possibility to a user participating in a webrtc conference to subscribe to a MediaPublication SubscribeToMediaServiceAsync(): gives the possibility to a user participating in a webrtc conference to subscribe to a MediaService Examples You can take a look to several examples available here On this pageManaging conferencesCheck permissionsCheck conference statusGet the list of participants and talkersMute/unmute a participant, raise hand, lower hand, or all handsRemove a participantList the media used and the people who used them.Manage conference recordingManage your own mediaExamplesWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

You need an account associated to a PBX System - like OXO or OXE. If you have an account associated to a cloud PBX please refer to the guide Managing hub telephony Using HybridTelephony service you can make call, hang up and hold/unhold call. You can also transfer the call and create a conference using 2 calls already in progress. You call also manage your nomadic status and your call forward status. A specific example about Hybrid Telephony is available here Get telephony status, PBX Agent info and the device type used (Virtual terminal or not) First you must know if the hybrid telephony service is available (so if you have the permission to use this feature). You must use the GetHybridTelephonyStatus(). If you have the permission you can know the PBX Agent version used using GetHybridPBXAgentInformation() and if your are using a Virtual terminal or not using IsVirtualTerminal(). Event HybridTelephonyStatusUpdated is also triggered when the status of the hybrid telephony service is updated. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HybridTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHybridTelephony(); ... //Once connected // Do we have the right to use the telephony feature ? if( telephony.GetHybridTelephonyStatus() ) { // Get PBX Agent information PbxAgentInfo pbxAgentInfo = telephony.GetHybridPBXAgentInformation(); // Do we use a virtaul terminal or not ? Boolean isVirtualTerminal = telephony.IsVirtualTerminal(); } Check call features : Deflect, Transfer , Conference To know if you can deflect and/or transfer calls, you must use DeflectCallAvailable() and TransferCallAvailable(). To know if you can create a conference from 2 active calls, you must use ConferenceCallAvailable(). Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HybridTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHybridTelephony(); ... //Once connected Boolean deflectCallAvailable = telephony.DeflectCallAvailable(); Boolean transferCallAvailable = telephony.TransferCallAvailable(); Boolean conferenceCallAvailable = telephony.ConferenceCallAvailable(); Check voice mail feature and get its number To know if you have a voice mail, you must use VoiceMailAvailable(). To know the voice mail number, you must use GetVoiceMailPhoneNumber(). Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HybridTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHybridTelephony(); ... //Once connected Boolean voiceMailAvailable = telephony.VoiceMailAvailable(); String voiceMailNumber = telephony.GetVoiceMailPhoneNumber(); // Return NULL is voice mail is not available Make a call You can make a call using MakeCallAsync() or MakeCallToMevoAsync(). Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HybridTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHybridTelephony(); ... //Once connected String phoneNumber = \"156\"; // An internal number to reach an person in your enterprise // OR // String phoneNumber = \"+33612345678\"; // A canonical phone number var sdkResult = await telephony.MakeCallAsync(phoneNumber); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call has started from the server String callId = callback.Id; // Id ot the call } else { // A pb occurs .... } Answer, Release, Transfer, Hold, Retrieve call With Call object, you can easily manage it using AnswerCallAsync(), ReleaseCallAsync(), HoldCallAsync(), RetrieveCallAsync(), DeflectCallAsync() Once a call is hold use RetrieveCallAsync() to unhold it. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HybridTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHybridTelephony(); ... //Once connected Call currentCall; // A call previously set var sdkResult = await telephony.AnswerCallAsync(currentCalld); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call has been well answered } else { // A pb occurs .... } ... var sdkResult = await telephony.ReleaseCallAsync(currentCall); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call has been well released } else { // A pb occurs .... } ... var sdkResult = await telephony.HoldCallAsync(currentCall); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call has been hold } else { // A pb occurs .... } ... var sdkResult = await telephony.RetrieveCallAsync(currentCall); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call is no more hold } else { // A pb occurs .... } ...

    "content": "DocumentationManaging hub telephonyLTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17Managing hub telephony This guide explains how to manage hub telephony using HubTelephony service. You need an account associated to a cloud PBX. If you have an account associated to a PBX System - like OXO or OXE - please refer to the guide Managing hub telephony Using HubTelephony service you can make call, hang up and hold/unhold call. You can also transfer or deflect the call. You call also manage your call forward status. A specific example about Hub Telephony is available here. Get telephony status, PBX Agent info and the device used First you must know if the hub telephony service is available (so if you have the permission to use this feature). You must use the GetTelephonyStatus(). If you have the permission you can know the PBX Agent version used using GetPBXAgentInformation(), get information about emergency numbers using GetEmergencyNumbersAndOptionsAsync() and get information about devices (using GetCurrentDevice() and GetDevices()). If you have several devices, you can select which one is the current one using SetCurrentDeviceAsync(). Event TelephonyStatusUpdated is also triggered when the status of the hub telephony service is updated. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HubTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHubTelephony(); ... //Once connected // Do we have the right to use the telephony feature ? if( telephony.GetTelephonyStatus() ) { // Get PBX Agent information PbxAgentInfo pbxAgentInfo = telephony.GetPBXAgentInformation(); // Get emergency numbers / info? var sdkResult = await telephony.GetEmergencyNumbersAndOptionsAsync(); if(sdkResult.Success) { var emergencyNumbersAndOptions = sdkResult.Data; } // Get current device information var currentDevice = telephony.GetCurrentDevice(); } Check voice mail feature and get its number To know if you have a voice mail, you must use VoiceMailAvailable(). To know the voice mail number, you must use GetVoiceMailPhoneNumber(). Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HubTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHubTelephony(); ... //Once connected Boolean voiceMailAvailable = telephony.VoiceMailAvailable(); String voiceMailNumber = telephony.GetVoiceMailPhoneNumber(); // Return NULL is voice mail is not available Make a call You can make a call using MakeCallAsync() or MakeCallToMevoAsync(). Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HubTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHubTelephony(); ... //Once connected String phoneNumber = \"156\"; // An internal number to reach an person in your enterprise // OR // String phoneNumber = \"+33612345678\"; // A canonical phone number var sdkResult = await telephony.MakeCallAsync(phoneNumber); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call has started from the server String callId = callback.Id; // Id ot the call } else { // A pb occurs .... } Answer, Release, Transfer, Hold, Retrieve call With Call object, you can easily manage it using AnswerCallAsync(), ReleaseCallAsync(), HoldCallAsync(), RetrieveCallAsync(), DeflectCallAsync() Once a call is hold use RetrieveCallAsync() to unhold it. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HubTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHubTelephony(); ... //Once connected Call currentCall; // A call previously set var sdkResult = telephony.AnswerCallAsync(currentCalld); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call has been well answered } else { // A pb occurs .... } ... var sdkResult = telephony.ReleaseCallAsync(currentCall); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call has been well released } else { // A pb occurs .... } ... var sdkResult = telephony.HoldCallAsync(currentCall); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call has been hold } else { // A pb occurs .... } ... var sdkResult = telephony.RetrieveCallAsync(currentCall); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The call is no more hold } else { // A pb occurs .... } ... String phoneNumber = \"456\"; // An internal or a canonical phone number var sdkResult = telephony.DeflectCallAsync(currentCall, phoneNumber); { // The call has been well deflect } else { // A pb occurs .... } Tranfer, BlindTransfer call To perform a transfer, two calls in progress are necessary. One is necessary hold and the other one is active. Then using the two calls, you can use TransferCallAsync(). To blind transfer a call only you need to have one call in progress and a phone number and use BlindTransferCallAsync(). Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.HubTelephony telephony = myApp.GetHubTelephony(); ... //Once connected Call activeCall; // A call previously set as an active call Call heldCall; // A call previously set as an hold call var sdkResult = telephony.TransferCallAsync(activeCall, heldCall); if(sdkResult.Success) { // The active call has been transfered to the held call - your are no more in a call } else { // A pb occurs .... } ...

The create a desktop application for Mac, you need to use Xamarin.Mac. It is the Mac equivalent to a WinForm. Requirements To develop an application with Xamarin.Mac, you will need : a computer running on macOS High Sierra (10.13)+ XCode 9+ the latest version of Visual Studio for Mac To run an application built with Xamarin.Mac you can use a Mac computer running macOS 10.7 or higher. Install Visual Studio for Mac Install Visual Studio for Mac. Be sure to add the macOS (Cocoa) platform target during installation. Install XCode After the installation is complete, you will have a message telling you that you need to install XCode in order to compile your code. You will need an Apple ID to download it on the App Store. Once the download is over, you can launch the XCode so that it can install some additional components. XCode will be used to design the UI of your Xamarin.Mac app. To open it, you need to right-click on the file named Main.storyboard and select \"Open with XCode Interface Builder\". From then, you will be able to add components to your Interface. If you want more informations you can follow this tutorial. Create your project Create a Xamarin.Mac app (or Cocoa App) After that you can go back to Getting Started and Setup your Visual Studio project.

    "content": "DocumentationApplication loggingLTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17Application logging The Rainbow CSharp SDK is based on Microsoft Extension Logging (MEL). So it permits to use any back-ends log provider based on it. Here are some implementations: (Non-exhaustive list) Sentry provider for the Sentry service Serilog provider for the Serilog service elmah.io provider for the elmah.io service Loggr provider for the Loggr service NLog provider for the NLog service Graylog provider for the Graylog service Sharpbrake provider for the Sharpbrake service KissLog.net provider for the KissLog.net service Before, the SDK used Nlog internally. So now it's more flexible. If you find a bug in the Rainbon SDK C#, you have to provide logs to the support team so we can analysed it and fix it quickly. This guide is based on these full examples: Configure logger Configure multiple loggers How loggers are set in the Rainbow SDK C# In the SDK, each class which needs to log entries define a Ilogger object like this: using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; // .... private readonly ILogger log; To initialize / create it, the simplest way is to use CreateLogger method from Rainbow.LogFactory object like this: log = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateLogger<MyClass>(); // With MyClass the name of the current class Then to log information inside this class you have to use something like this: log.LogTrace(\"Add a log entry with TRACE level\"); log.LogDebug(\"Add a log entry with DEBUG level\"); log.LogInformation(\"Add a log entry with INFORMATION level\"); log.LogWarning(\"Add a log entry with WARNING level\"\") log.LogError(\"Add a log entry with ERROR level\"); log.LogCritical(\"Add a log entry with CRITICAL level\"); All logs will be stored in the same file. Prefix to log in different files Perhaps you don't want to log all information in the same file. Specifically if you are using several Rainbow.Application object in you project. It will be very difficult, even impossible, to analyse log files if several account are used in same time ... To avoid this, prefix are used - each different for each Rainbow.Application used. You can also use you own prefix to your specific need to log you own log in a different log file. To do this, you need to: use an unique prefix when creating a Rainbow.Application object use this prefix in your own code which are related to this Rainbow.Application object. So you will find in the same file for the same prefix, the SDK log entries and you own code relatd to it use another prefix (optional), if you want to have logs in a specific file: perhaps for the code which is global and which manages several Rainbow.Application objects using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; //... public class MyClass { private readonly ILogger log; //... public MyClass(String loggerPrefix) // Here the constructor accepts a loggerPrefix { // We create a logger which use this prefic log = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateLogger<MyClass>(loggerPrefix); // With MyClass the name of the current class // ... / We create a Rainbow.Application with the same prefix - so all logs of this Rainbow.Application object (and sub services) will be stored in same file than the log object create just before var rbApplication = = new Rainbow.Application(loggerPrefix: loggerPrefix); // We specify here the prefix use for log purpose } } Specific logger for WebRTC and S2S In the SDK, to log entries related to WebRTC or S2S, a specific Ilogger object is created in each class which needs it like this: It's not possible to set a prefix for the S2S logger. Because S2S is used to centralized events for several accounts in the sampe point - see Server to server (S2S) and XMPP events mode logWebRtc = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateWebRTCLogger(myLoggerPrefix); // It's the same than using: // logWebRtc = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateLogger(\"WEBRTC\", myLoggerPrefix); logS2S = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateS2SLogger(); // It's the same than using: // logS2S = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateLogger(\"S2S\"); Example in a class: using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; ... namespace Rainbow { public class MyClassUsingWebRTC { private static readonly ILogger log; private static readonly ILogger logWebRtc; ... public MyClassUsingWebRTC(String myLoggerPrefix) { log = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateLogger<MyClassUsingWebRTC>(myLoggerPrefix); // With \"MyClassUsingWebRTC\" the name of the current class logWebRtc = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateWebRTCLogger(myLoggerPrefix); // With \"MyClassUsingWebRTC\" the name of the current class ... } } public class MyClassUsingS2S { private static readonly ILogger log; private static readonly ILogger logS2S; ... public MyClassUsingS2S(String myLoggerPrefix) { log = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateLogger<MyClassUsingS2S>(myLoggerPrefix); // With \"MyClassUsingS2S\" the name of the current class logS2S = Rainbow.LogFactory.CreateS2SLogger(); // With \"MyClassUsingS2S\" the name of the current class ... } } } Then to log entries, I could use log and/or logWebRtc and/or logS2S when it's necesssary. // I need to log so"

It's a small library but do the job quite well and ensure to the SDK to be AOT (Ahead Of Time) compatible - mandatory for the SDK to support some specific environment like Unity with IL2CPP backend This choice also avoid to follow evolution/corrections of NewtonSoft.Json or System.Text.Json. It also avoid to have a specific version according your environment. This document explains how to use this embedded library with some utility methods added to facilitate the job.

JSONBool inherits from JSONNode calls and represent a JSON Node which is a boolean in JSON representation JSONNull inherits from JSONNode calls and represent a JSON Node which is a null value in JSON representation JSONObject inherits from JSONNode calls and represent a JSON Node which is an object in JSON representation. So it contains one or several childrens JSONArray inherits from JSONNode calls and represent a JSON Node which is an array in JSON representation. So it contains one or several childrens Value property of a JSONNode gives the JSON representation of the node. Tag property of a JSONNode gives the JSONNodeType of the node: Array, Object, String, Number, NullValue, Boolean, None.

    "content": "DocumentationData in cacheLTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17Data storage and connection / reconnection Prerequisite You must first know how to connect and manage auto-reconnection service using the SDK: Connect to Rainbow. Auto Reconnection. Introduction The SDK cannot retrieve all data \"at once\" once connected to the server. In addition, this connection can be interrupted and the data must be synchronized again. This guide aims: To list what data is stored To understand when they are available they depend on the user's license they depend on the options used in the SDK To understand the connection and reconnection problem to synchronize this data The last chapter, via code example, shows how to handle all of this. Connection / Reconnection (REST and Event Pipe) The SDK is connected to the Rainbow server using two different channels: REST API (HTTP requests): asynchonous connection based on secutiry token with a \"time to live\" XMPP (or eventually S2S) event pipe: web socket connection which needs permanent connection. From a global point of view, REST API is used for static data and event pipe for dynamic data (presence, instant messaging, ...) To be fully operational, the SDK must create a valid link on both channels (authenticated, connected) and have enough data/information (license, settings, ...) after connection or a reconnection. As developper, you only know if the SDK is connected or not using event ConnectionStateChanged event in Application service but you cannot know which one specificalyy is connected/disconnected. To give more details, event pipe disconnection occurs more often. For example, if there is a network trouble for a short period, the event pipe will be disconnected but not the REST API channel. And usually, if the REST API channel is disconnected, the event pipe is also disconnected. Bubbles and how they are managed To receive or send messages or to get dynamic information about a Bubble (for example that there is a conference in progress), the SDK must first join it. It also called a bubble affiliation. The SDK can do it: only when the event pipe connection is operational and join Bubbles one by one. So, the more bubbles you have, the longer it takes to join them all. Contacts presence To know the Aggregated Presence (also called Unified Ptesence) of one contact, the SDK must first receive information of each of his devices: One for each client used: Rainbow Web client, Rainbow Mobile Phone (Adnroid and/or iOS, ...) Optionnaly, one to manage his telephony device (Rainbow Hub or OXO/OXE) Optionnaly, one to manage his calendar presence (Google Calendar, Office 365, ...) Optionnaly, one to manage his Team presence (Google Calendar, Office 365, ...) Now multiply all these by the number of contats in the roster, and you can see that there is a lot of Presence messages to handle. And this messages are received only when the event pipe is connected. Further more, presence Telephony data To ensure to have accurate information, Telephony settings are obtained using the the event pipe. So we must be first connected to it. Once connected, the SDK waits to receive for the telephony system its status before to ask more information. SDK Events The SDK provides a way to know: when the user is well or badly authenticated: AuthenticationFailed or AuthenticationSucceeded events in Application service are raised when the user is connected/authenticated on both channels AND when enough data are retrieved/refreshed, ConnectionStateChanged event in Application service is raised with a state equals to ConnectionState.Connected Each time a Bubble has been joined, BubbleAffiliationChanged event in Bubbles service is raised. when all Bubbles have been joined (and even if current user has no bubble), BubbleAffiliationsPerformed event in Bubbles service is raised. Note: You can start to use the SDK after the step 2 (before it's now allowed). It you need to use a Bubble, ensure to have received event BubbleAffiliationChanged for this Bubble or wait for event BubbleAffiliationsPerformed The delay between step 2 and step 4 is direclty dependent of the number of active bubbles. After step 2, other data are retrieved, see the list in a next chapter for full details. If at least one channel is disconnected, ConnectionStateChanged event in Application service is raised with a state equals to ConnectionState.Disconnected. To resume: If you don't have to manage a lot of Bubbles, using event ConnectionStateChanged is enough. If you have to manage a lot of of Bubbles, uses event BubbleAffiliationsPerformed to ensure that the SDK has already joined all of them. If you have to manage a lot of of Bubbles but the connection/reconnection delay is very critical for you, uses event BubbleAffiliationChanged to check which Bubbles have been already joined before to use them. You can also use the method IsBubbleAffiliated About Presence, you have in Contacts service 2 events to use if you want to manage them: ContactPresenceCh"

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedLTS release 1.XPublished on 2024-07-01Getting Started Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow CSharp SDK Medias. This SDK can be used as a standalone package without the need of Rainbow Account, Rainbow Server or Rainbow Infrastructure. This SDK can be used on these platforms: Windows, MacOs, and Linux. Only x64 platforms are supported. Android and iOS are NOT YET supported. Features It permits to manage Audio and Video streams using: Local / Remote Files IP TV, Live Stream Server Devices like Webcam, Screen/Monitor, Microphone, Speaker, Headset, ... To access remote streams all this protocols are supported. An Audio and/or Video Stream (whatever its source) is calles a Media in this SDK. A Media can be composed of one Audio stream and/or one Video stream. Using a Media it's then possible, for example, to create a Media Player: Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Seek actions are possible. Using one Media or severals, it's then possible to create a MediaFiltered using a Video filter and/or an Audio filter. Video Filter allows to: scale, crop, pad, resize, change fps, add subtitles create mosaic, overlay, dynamic mask Audio filter is not yet supported. The MediaFiltered will use the Audio stream of the specified Media. On the fly you can change the filter. The Audio/Video stream of the MediaFiltered will be updated in consequence without the need to re-start all Media used. Filter - List, Syntax and Examples Filter - List The list of available Audio filters are available here The list of available Video filters are available here Filter - Syntax Same syntax used in FFmpeg can be used in this package. The best thing to do it's to test first your filter using ffmpeg with a command line using \"-vf\" parameter (to set video filter). The same value can be used as filter in this SDK. Filter - Examples Here some examples than can be used. Using only one Media To have video in gray: format=gray To blur the video: avgblur=10 To scale the video: scale=400:-2 To crop the video: crop=400:400 To draw a text on the video: drawtext=text=%{localtime\\: %X }:fontcolor=white:fontsize=40:y=(main_h-text_h)/2:x=(main_w-text_w)/2 To add subtitles on the video using subtitles from the file \"c:\\media\\TOEFLTest.mp4\" subtitles=f=c\\\\:\\\\\\\\medias\\\\\\\\TOEFLTest.mp4:si=0 Several options can set in same time, for example, to scale then pad the video: scale=200:-2,pad=320:200:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2 Here, we blur a zone of a video and add also subtitles: [0:v]crop=400:400,avgblur=10[fg];[0:v][fg]overlay=(main_w-overlay_w)/2:(main_h-overlay_h)/2[blured];[blured]subtitles=f=c\\\\:\\\\\\\\media\\\\\\\\TOEFLTest.mp4:si=0 Using two Medias To display two videos streams in one stream. Each video stream is first scaled and padde to a 320x240 stream. Then they are displayed vertically.

This SDK provides additional services / features to the Rainbow CSharp SDK (core) library. So you need first to understand how to use it. Nuget package The SDK is provided as a Nuget package available here This package targets .Net Standard 2.0, .Net Standard 2.1 and .Net 8.0 WebRTC features Permits to manage WebRTC communications: Peer To Peer or in a Conference using Rainbow environment (https://developers.openrainbow.com/home) Peer To Peer communication features: Answer, Decline, Make, Retract, Hang up call Add / Remove Video or Sharing Mute / Unmute Audio, Video or Sharing Call status: Ringing incoming, ringing outgoing, in progress, ... Audio Stream: Output and Input are supported Video Stream: Output is supported. Input is not supported (work still in progress) Conference features: Start, Join Conference Participants list Publishers list Mute / Unmute: current user but also other Peers if current user is a moderator of the conference Call status: Ringing incoming, ringing outgoing, in progress, ...

Input is not supported (work still in progress) Abstractions and Implementations This package use abstractions to offer those WebRTC features based on specific implementations. For the moment, two implementations are available: Rainbow CSharp SDK WebRTC.Desktop Third library used: SIPSorcery, FFmpeg libraries and SDL2 Comptatible Windows, MacOs and Linux platforms Rainbow CSharp SDK WebRTC.Unity Available only in private access for the moment Third library used: Unity and WebRTC for Unity Comptatible with Windows, MacOs and Linux, Android, iOS platforms Developping with the Rainbow.WebRTC SDK Quick overview on how to use the Rainbow.WebRTC sdk to develop a webrtc enabled application. It is intended to be about general principles and is not specific to the implementation. For specific, check documentation of he implementation you want to use. Instantiation Create a Rainbow.Application object Rainbow Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Configure application credentials and platform Enable restrictions on Conferences Monitor ConnectionStateChanged and InitializationPerformed Call Login() The SDK will try to connect to the platform using the supplied (application and user) credentials. If it failed you are informed in the optional callback. When it's done initializing and retrieving informations it will raise the InitializationPerformed signal. At this stage the SDK can be used. If your application makes use of bubbles or conferences, when InitializationPerformed is received it should call Bubbles.GetAllBubbles(). It is the right time to instantiate a WebRTCCommunications object, which will make it possible make calls or join conference. You can find more informations about the Rainbow SDK Here. This quick diagram summarizes how to initialize an application who would use WebRTCCommunications. Events in WebRTCCommunications The most importants events to handle to issue webrtc calls in your applications are CallUpdated , MediaPublicationUpdated and OnTrack. When a user receives a call, or is issuing the call, the WebRTCCommunications class informs him of the progression of the call using the CallUpdated events. The event provides you with an instance of the Call class, containing many useful information like The status The local and remote medias established on the call The participants The call Id which is needed to perform actions on this calls, like decline the call, hangup, publish some medias.. The other important event to handle is MediaPublicationUpdated. This happens each time a local or remote media is added to the call. A MediaPublicationUpdated event provides a MediaPublication object which can be used to subscribe to a MediaPublication using the method WebRTCCommunications.SubscribeToMediaPublication. Calling this method means that your application is interested in this media. If you subscribe to a media publication WebRTCommunications will send you the associated MediaStreamTrack using OnTrack event. Making Calls and Receiving Calls Here is a simplified (and incomplete) diagram showing how to use WebRTCCommunications events and methods to establish an audio Peer to peer call, using the MakeCall method. When another user calls your application, WebRTCCommunications emits a CallUpdated with a CallStatus of RINGING_INCOMING . To accept the call use WebRTCCommunications.AnswerCall, and to decline use WebRTCCommunications.RejectCall. What happens after AnswerCall is similar to what happens afte"

It's an Assembly library based on CSharp for connecting your application to Rainbow. This assembly is multi-platform: you can use it on Windows, MacOs, Linux but also on Android, iOS and more. Its powerful APIs enable you to create the best application that connect to Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow. This tutorial will help you start with the ALE Rainbow SDK for CSharp (Core) by setting your environment wether you are using Windows, Linux or MacOS. UI Controls according to build quickly / easily an applicatin are provided in others packages specific by platform. But their interface are the same what ever the platform. Prerequisites Assembly in .Net Standard 2.0, .Net Standard 2.1, .Net 6.0 and .Net 8.0 The SDK is an Assembly targeting .Net Standard 2.0, .Net Standard 2.1, .Net 6.0 and .Net 6.0 so it can be used in those environments: .NET and .Net Core 2.0+ .NET Framework 4.6.1+ Mono 5.4+ Xamarin.iOS 10.14+ Xamarin.Android 8.0+ Unity 2018.1+ Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299+ More details here Nuget package The SDK is provided as a Nuget package available here Dependencies are all managed by Nuget package system. Development environment You can use: \"Visual Studio for Windows\" - the community edition is free \"Visual Studio for Mac\" \"Visual Studio Code\" - Free for Linux, Mac and Windows If you are using a computer running on MacOS, you can follow this guide to setup your development environment. Setup your Visual Studio project Install \"Rainbow.CSharp.SDK\" as Nuget package In Studio Visual Studio 2019 (or more recent) Use the NuGet Package Manager UI and install the package \"Rainbow.CSharp.SDK\" Initialize the SDK Step 1 : Create a Rainbow application on the developers web site To use the SDK you need an applicationID and a secretKey from the developers website. These information allow you to identify your application and allow you to use the rainbow platform. For more information, see Applications lifecycle which explains what is the purpose, how to create an application and how to get the application ID and the secret key. The hostname is also necessary to know which server is used: the sandbox or the production server Step 2 : Initialize the SDK In your development environment, create an Rainbow.Application object like this: Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); myApp.SetApplicationInfo(applicationID, secretKey); myApp.SetHostInfo(hostname); Where myApp is your application object: with applicationID / secretKey from your Rainbow application created in step 1. with hostname according the server used (`sandbox.openrainbow.com' or 'openrainbow.com') After that you can Connect to Rainbow.

    "content": "DocumentationEvents, Callback and SDKResultLTS release 2.6.XPublished on 2021-12-13Events, Callbacks and SDKResult object Events and asynchronous methods The SDK is event-based and most methods are asynchronous. An event is a message sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action. For example at any time, the state of the connection with the server can change: no more network connection for example (lost wifi...). It is therefore necessary to process this type of information at all times The methods are asynchronous because the SDK must request the server using REST requests, which can take some time. A callback is used to inform the user when the operation is finished - normally or with error. So you need to know how events and callback worked in C# if you want to understand how to use the SDK. IF you are already familiar with them you don't need to read all this guide but perhaps just the chapter about the SDKResult object. Register to events To register to an event you have to specify the method which will be used to receive the message raised by the event. This method must have the correct signature according the event used. For example if we focus on InitializationPerformed and ConnectionStateChanged of the Rainbow.Application object, they are defined like this: public event EventHandler<EventArgs> InitializationPerformed; public event EventHandler<Rainbow.Events.ConnectionStateEventArgs> ConnectionStateChanged; So to receive these events we must create a method for each, for example Application_InitializationPerformed and Application_ConnectionStateChanged like this private void Application_InitializationPerformed(object sender, EventArgs e) { // TO DO ... } private void Application_ConnectionStateChanged(object? sender, Rainbow.Events.ConnectionStateEventArgs e) { // TO DO ... } Once we have defined these methods, we must indicate that they must be used when these events are used like this: // Create Rainbow.Application object Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); // Register to event InitializationPerformed myApp.InitializationPerformed += Application_InitializationPerformed; // Register to event InitializationPerformed myApp.ConnectionStateChanged += Application_ConnectionStateChanged; Notice in the previous code the use of += to link the event to the method. Notice also that these methods will be used ONLY when the object myApp need to raise the event InitializationPerformed and ConnectionStateChanged. So the full code will be: // Create Rainbow.Application object Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); // Register to event InitializationPerformed myApp.InitializationPerformed += Application_InitializationPerformed; // Register to event InitializationPerformed myApp.ConnectionStateChanged += Application_ConnectionStateChanged; // Define method Application_InitializationPerformed which will be called when event InitializationPerformed will be raised private void Application_InitializationPerformed(object sender, EventArgs e) { // TO DO ... } // Define method Application_InitializationPerformed which will be called when event ConnectionStateChanged will be raised private void Application_ConnectionStateChanged(object? sender, Rainbow.Events.ConnectionStateEventArgs e) { // TO DO ... } It's possible to register several times to the same event using the same method (in this case the method will be called several times) or a different one still using += Unregister to events It's higly recommended to unregister to events if they are no more necessary - for example in desctructor of objects. For this you just have to use -= with method(s) used to receive the event. So to continue our example, we will use this: // Unregister to event InitializationPerformed myApp.InitializationPerformed -= Application_InitializationPerformed; // Unregister to event InitializationPerformed myApp.ConnectionStateChanged -= Application_ConnectionStateChanged; Manage callback A lot of methods in the SDK use callback mainly when the server is implied to provide the correct reponse. When a callback is used, it means that : The method is asynchronous and the result of the method will be provided in the callback. The code continue immediately after the call to asynchronous method The callback will be called in another thread that the one used to call the method To know if a method is asynchronous just look for Action or Action<...> int its parameters. For example in the Rainbow.Contacts service, we have this public methods available: public Company GetCurrentCompanyFromCache(); public void GetCurrentCompany(Action<SdkResult<Company>> callback); GetCurrentCompanyFromCache() is not asynchronous and will provide a Company object using data in the cache of the SDK. GetCurrentCompany has Action<...> as parameter. So it's an asynchronous method. The result will be provided by a callback. Below an example how to manage these both methods: // Create Rainbow.Application object Rainbow.Application my"

See first Getting Started if it's not the case. Then you need to have a valid account (i.e. a login and a password). You also need to know how events and callback are managed in C# and also know how to use the SDKResult object. If it's not the case read first this guide Events to handle In order to follow correctly the login process, you have to handle several events from the Rainbow.Application object: AuthenticationFailed: raised when the authentication has failed - bad login/pwd and/or bad applicationID and a secretKey AuthenticationSucceeded: raised when the authentication has succeeded ConnectionStateChanged: raised when the connection stated has changed (ConnectionState.Disconnected, ConnectionState.Connecting, ConnectionState.Connected) InitializationPerformed: one connected this event is raised when the SDK is fully initialized. It will be necessary to wait the event InitializationPerformed before to use the SDK and not just the event ConnectionStateChanged with the status ConnectionState.Connected because internally the SDK needs to get minimal information from the server to be ready. For example, the SDK needs to get features and settings available for the current user before to be fully operationnal. It's done once the SDK is connected.

    "content": "DocumentationXMPP or Server to Server events modeLTS release 2.6.XPublished on 2021-12-13Server to server (S2S) and XMPP events mode By default, the CSharp SDK uses XMPP to handle events from server using a Web socket. It's also XMPP which is used to send IM messages. It's the standard and official way if you are creating an Desktop or Mobile application or small bots with this SDK. If you want to create advanced bots or high availability and scalable server applications, it's better to use S2S (server to server) event mode. The CSharp SDK allows you, almost transparently, to use one of these event modes without the need for specific code. Only some events and methods are not available/allowed in S2S event mode (Cf. Events and Methods available). In the end of this guide, we explain a development strategy to help you set up your environment. Select an event mode To select a specific event mode, you only need to set if before the login to the Rainbow Server using EventMode property from Restrictions object accessible in Rainbow.Application. By default, the event mode selected is XMPP. If you choose S2S event mode, you also need to specify a callback URL (also called Webhook). See next chapter to understand the architecture involved in S2S and why/how the callback URL is used. String callbackUrl = \"https://myWebServer.com/callbackPath\"; Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); // Set S2S as event mode myApp.Restrictions.EventMode = Restrictions.SDKEventMode.S2S; // Need to specify in this event mode the Callback URL used to receive events myApp.SetS2SCallbackUrl(callbackUrl); // Now we can specify the Application ID, the Secret Key and the hostnam to use like always myApp.SetApplicationInfo(applicationID, secretKey); myApp.SetHostInfo(hostname); // We want to know when the initialization process has been performed correctly myApp.InitializationPerformed += MyApp_InitializationPerformed; // Finally we can log to the server myApp.Login(\"@email\" , \"password\", callback => { if(callback.Result.Success) { // The login / pwd is correct // The SDK continue internally initialization process. We need to wait its end. } else { // A pb occurs if(callback.Result.Type == SdkError.SdkErrorType.IncorrectUse) { // Bad parameter(s) used string errMsg = callback.Result.IncorrectUseError.ErrorMsg; } else { // Exception occurs Exception e = callback.Result.ExceptionError; } } }); private void MyApp_InitializationPerformed(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (myApp.IsInitialized()) { // Login process has been performed and the initialization process has been performed correctly // We can now use any features } } XMPP event mode and architecture When XMPP Event mode is used, a WebSocket is created between the SDK and the Rainbow cloud server to receive events from server but also to send data for IM and Presence features. REST API is also used to get data from Server S2S event mode and architecture When S2S Event mode is used, there is no web socket but a callback URL is used (also called Webhook) to received events from Server. REST API is used to get data from Server and also to manage IM and Presence features. So if you want to handle a lot of messages you can scale your architecture using a load balancer. S2S event mode - handle events from Rainbow server In XMPP event mode, you have nothing to do to deal with incoming data from the web socket. They are automatically parsed internally and according the result an event is raised by the SDK. In S2S event mode, it's a little different. It's up to you to configure your web server, set the correct callbackURL and give to SDK the content of data received by this webhook. Your web server will receive data with a specific HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, etc...) with a specific absolute path (for example mypath based on the previous screenshoot since the callback URL used is https://my.derver.domain/mypath) with a specific content (JSON content) with a content type You must check that the content type is equal to application/json. For the 3 other data, you don't have to analyse / parse, you just need to provide them to the SDK - then it will parse the information, and, like in XMPP mode, according the result, an event is raised by the SDK. To do this you have to use the method ParseCallbackContent of the S2SEventPipe object. This method returns a boolean to indicate if the parsing has been done correctly or not. If the parsing is done incorrectly, your web server must return an HTTP 406 Not Acceptable answer. If the parsing is done correctly, your web server must return an HTTP 200 Ok answer. Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Rainbow.S2SEventPipe s2sEventPipe = myApp.GetS2SEventPipe(); ... // You log to the Rainbow server using S2S event mode and specifing a callbackURL ... // Your Web server is receiving data from the Rainbow Server // 4 distinct data are necessaries String httpVerb; String urlAbsolutePath; String content; String contentType; // You also need"

    "content": "DocumentationChangelogLTS release 2.6.XPublished on 2021-12-13CompareSDK (Core) for C# [2.6.26-LTS] - 2024-11-22 Fixed Ensure to send one by one message to XMPP server (when XMPP event mode is used) Support by default HTTP Status 204 (No Content) Application service: avoid to set default presence to Offline. Use Online instead AutoReconnection service: badly managed 401 Unauthorized when renewing authentication token Bubbles service: avoid triggering BubbleAffiliationChanged in inappropriate cases. [2.6.25-LTS] - 2024-07-17 Fixed Internally use XmlElement object instead of String to avoid problem of parsing. Bubbles service: GetAllMembers() and GetMembersFromCache() methods - memberPrivilege filter badly used if **memberStatus ** filter is null. Added Company object: AutoAddToUserNetwork property [2.6.24-LTS] - 2024-07-01 Info For simplification and from this version, the SDK always retrieves the list of bubbles and the complete list of their members (if Restrictions.UseBubbles is used) and the list of conversations after connection/reconnection. It is therefore no longer necessary to ask for it. A new guide has been added to describe what data is stored in the cache, and when it is obtained/refreshed during connection or reconnection phases. Fixed Avoid crash in very restrictive environment (like in Alpine linux distribution) where CulturInfo object cannot be created. Ensure to answer to XMPP server on close message (rfc7395 - section 3.6) Application service: LoginWithToken method accepts token as string or ApplicationToken as JSON. Bubbles service: BubbleMemberUpdated event might not be triggered after a reconnection or when a new bubble owner was set. InstantMessaging service: SendAckMessage method now always escapes content. Added Bubble object: LastActivityDate and UsersById (dictionary of Users by Id). Bubbles service: BubbleAffiliationsPerformed() event is fired after login/reconnect when the current user has joined all their bubbles. If it is not a member of any bubble, the event is also triggered. Bubbles service: IsUnsubscribed() to know if user is unsubscribed to a bubble. Bubbles service: GetBubbles() now ensure to provide the full list of members (even if there is more than 100 members). Bubbles service: GetBubbles() and GetAllBubblesFromCache() have a new optional parameter memberStatus (null by default) to filter results. Bubbles service: GetMembers() have two new optionals parameters memberStatus (null by default) and memberPrivilege (null by default) to filter results. Bubbles service: GetOwner(), GetModerators() and IsBubbleAffiliated() methods BubbleMember object: UserJid property HttpClient object: If necessary, check inner-exception to avoid unnecessary disconnection. HttpClient object: To enhance performance, according REST API used and server settings, specific HTTP Headers are added - for example to manage Conference or Teams Presence using the correct Data Center. Restrictions object: UseTelephony and UseBubbles (both to true by default to be backwards compatible) allow to limit the use of Telephony and Bubbles services if they are not necessary. Restrictions object: LogBubbleMembers (false by default) to log also members when a log entry about Bubble is saved Util.LogAnonymously(): To log entries anonomouslys (by default) or not - useful in development phase. Util.RaiseEvent(): permits to log events raised or not raised according values of Restrictions.LogEvent and Restrictions.LogEventRaised (both true by default). If an event is not raised, it means that no code is using it. WebRTCSettings object: Once loggued/connected, if WebRTC is used, settings are retrieved and accessible using Application.WebRTCSettings property Changed Breaking BubbleMemberEventArgs: Member as BubbleMember objects replaces ContactJid, ContactId, Status and Privilege Breaking Restrictions: AlertMessage renamed to UseAlerts for coherency Util.LogString(): Still log first and last caracter but now log also the full length (before caracter '-' was used to replace hidden caracters) Util.Raise(): Now Obsolete, use instead Util.RaiseEvent() Util.SerializeException(): Use standard way to log exception. It permits to have more info (call stack for example) .Net 6.0 as target platform has been removed (obsolete). .Net Std 2.0, 2.1 and .Net 8.0 are still in targets platform. [2.6.23.1-LTS] - 2024-05-28 Fixed HttpStatuCode (like 404 or 406) returned by the server can be badly managed - impact only two methods: Bubbles.GetBubbleLink() and Contacts.SearchContactByPhoneNumber() [2.6.23-LTS] - 2024-05-27 Fixed Bubbles service: IsCreator() badly used userid default value Message object: bad use of System.Format() when using Message.ToString() which could prevent to raise event MessageReceived in InstantMessaging Ensure to remove presence level of current user when disconnected from event pipe Support Mono Runtime in .Net Standard 2.1 (already supported using .Net Standdard 2.0) Added Administration service: GetDomainNameF"

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedLTS release 1.XPublished on 2024-07-01Getting Started Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow CSharp SDK Medias. This SDK can be used as a standalone package without the need of Rainbow Account, Rainbow Server or Rainbow Infrastructure. This SDK can be used on these platforms: Windows, MacOs, and Linux. Only x64 platforms are supported. Android and iOS are NOT YET supported. Features It permits to manage Audio and Video streams using: Local / Remote Files IP TV, Live Stream Server Devices like Webcam, Screen/Monitor, Microphone, Speaker, Headset, ... To access remote streams all this protocols are supported. An Audio and/or Video Stream (whatever its source) is calles a Media in this SDK. A Media can be composed of one Audio stream and/or one Video stream. Using a Media it's then possible, for example, to create a Media Player: Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Seek actions are possible. Using one Media or severals, it's then possible to create a MediaFiltered using a Video filter and/or an Audio filter. Video Filter allows to: scale, crop, pad, resize, change fps, add subtitles create mosaic, overlay, dynamic mask Audio filter is not yet supported. The MediaFiltered will use the Audio stream of the specified Media. On the fly you can change the filter. The Audio/Video stream of the MediaFiltered will be updated in consequence without the need to re-start all Media used. Filter - List, Syntax and Examples Filter - List The list of available Audio filters are available here The list of available Video filters are available here Filter - Syntax Same syntax used in FFmpeg can be used in this package. The best thing to do it's to test first your filter using ffmpeg with a command line using \"-vf\" parameter (to set video filter). The same value can be used as filter in this SDK. Filter - Examples Here some examples than can be used. Using only one Media To have video in gray: format=gray To blur the video: avgblur=10 To scale the video: scale=400:-2 To crop the video: crop=400:400 To draw a text on the video: drawtext=text=%{localtime\\: %X }:fontcolor=white:fontsize=40:y=(main_h-text_h)/2:x=(main_w-text_w)/2 To add subtitles on the video using subtitles from the file \"c:\\media\\TOEFLTest.mp4\" subtitles=f=c\\\\:\\\\\\\\medias\\\\\\\\TOEFLTest.mp4:si=0 Several options can set in same time, for example, to scale then pad the video: scale=200:-2,pad=320:200:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2 Here, we blur a zone of a video and add also subtitles: [0:v]crop=400:400,avgblur=10[fg];[0:v][fg]overlay=(main_w-overlay_w)/2:(main_h-overlay_h)/2[blured];[blured]subtitles=f=c\\\\:\\\\\\\\media\\\\\\\\TOEFLTest.mp4:si=0 Using two Medias To display two videos streams in one stream.

For the moment, two implementations are available: Rainbow CSharp SDK WebRTC.Desktop Third library used: SIPSorcery, FFmpeg libraries and SDL2 Comptatible Windows, MacOs and Linux platforms Rainbow CSharp SDK WebRTC.Unity Available only in private access for the moment Third library used: Unity and WebRTC for Unity Comptatible with Windows, MacOs and Linux, Android, iOS platforms Developping with the Rainbow.WebRTC SDK Quick overview on how to use the Rainbow.WebRTC sdk to develop a webrtc enabled application. It is intended to be about general principles and is not specific to the implementation. For specific, check documentation of he implementation you want to use. Instantiation Create a Rainbow.Application object Rainbow Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application(); Configure application credentials and platform Enable restrictions on Conferences Monitor ConnectionStateChanged and InitializationPerformed Call Login() The SDK will try to connect to the platform using the supplied (application and user) credentials. If it failed you are informed in the optional callback. When it's done initializing and retrieving informations it will raise the InitializationPerformed signal. At this stage the SDK can be used. If your application makes use of bubbles or conferences, when InitializationPerformed is received it should call Bubbles.GetAllBubbles(). It is the right time to instantiate a WebRTCCommunications object, which will make it possible make calls or join conference. You can find more informations about the Rainbow SDK Here. This quick diagram summarizes how to initialize an application who would use WebRTCCommunications. Events in WebRTCCommunications The most importants events to handle to issue webrtc calls in your applications are CallUpdated , MediaPublicationUpdated and OnTrack. When a user receives a call, or is issuing the call, the WebRTCCommunications class informs him of the progression of the call using the CallUpdated events. The event provides you with an instance of the Call class, containing many useful information like The status The local and remote medias established on the call The participants The call Id which is needed to perform actions on this calls, like decline the call, hangup, publish some medias.. The other important event to handle is MediaPublicationUpdated. This happens each time a local or remote media is added to the call. A MediaPublicationUpdated event provides a MediaPublication object which can be used to subscribe to a MediaPublication using the method WebRTCCommunications.SubscribeToMediaPublication. Calling this method means that your application is interested in this media. If you subscribe to a media publication WebRTCommunications will send you the associated MediaStreamTrack using OnTrack event. Making Calls and Receiving Calls Here is a simplified (and incomplete) diagram showing how to use WebRTCCommunications events and methods to establish an audio Peer to peer call, using the MakeCall method. When another user calls your application, WebRTCCommunications emits a CallUpdated with a CallStatus of RINGING_INCOMING . To accept the call use WebRTCCommunications.AnswerCall, and to decline use WebRTCCommunications.RejectCall. What happens after AnswerCall is similar to wh"

Framework targets .Net Core App 3.1 is no more targetted (already deprecated by Microsoft). .Net Standardd 2.0 / 2.1 and .Net 6.0 are still targetted [0.0.9] - STS - 2023-05-26 Fix: Test to check if Video subscription must be done was incorrect In Conference, when sharing is added, a session-initiate is received. We have to send session-terminate if we don't subscribe to it. In Conference: Subscribe/Unsubscribe on Media before/after the join is now well managed. In P2P, Video and Sharing stream from remote are handled faster Correclty handle stream status to create a valid SDP Enhancements: Architecture has been reworked to build a common library compatible with a Desktop WebRTC implementation and Unity WebRTC implementation. The Desktop WebRTC implementation is equivalent in term of features, dependencies and target platform as the previous version of this library: - Based on SipSorcery, FFmpeg and SDL2 - Target Windows, MacOS and Linux The Unity WebRTC implementation permits to use Rainbow SDK C# with WebRTC features in a Unity project - Unity use the WebRTC implementation provided by the Chromium project. - Unity targets Android, iOS but also Windows, Mac, Linux, Extended Reality devices (XR), Consoles (PS5, XBox, Switch), WebGL It was necessary to create a new package called Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Abstractions which provide objects and interfaces to inherit / use to be compatible with this new package architecture. To provide Desktop WebRTC implementation, a new Nuget package, Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Desktop, implements interfaces and use objects defined in Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Abstractions. To provide Unity WebRTC implementation, a new Unity package, Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Unity, implements interfaces and use objects defined in Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Abstractions. This package is not yet available publicly but it has been tested with success on Android and some XR devices There is no more media or device management in this package. It's done in each implementation since it's specific for each. [0.0.8] - STS - 2023-02-10 Thanks to new version of the SDK C# Medias, it's now possible to decode incoming media (Audio, Video and Sharing ) from P2P call or Conference call. Connecting state is now correctly managed to a"

This is done by injecting an Application ID and a Secret Key. This guide will help you understand how to connect to Rainbow. Preamble For more information on the application lifecycle, you can read the tutorial Application lifecycle. When you want to develop your Rainbow application and use it with real users, it needs to be authenticated by Rainbow and needs an application ID and secret key. If you don't provide an application ID and secret key, your application will not be able to connect to Rainbow and all requests will be refused by Rainbow. Create an application The first thing to do is to create an application on the Rainbow for Developers. Open your browser and navigate to the Rainbow for developers Sign in using your Rainbow account In the Applications panel, click on the button \"Create new application\" Fill the application information and click on the button \"Save\" Your application is now created. You can use it on the Rainbow Developers Sandboxed Platform. Get your application ID and secret key Once your application is created, you can retrieve the application ID and secret key by clicking on the button \"View Key\". Keep this information for yourself and do not share it with anyone. Inject your application ID and secret key <html lang=\"en\"> ... <body> <script> import rainbowSDK from 'rainbow-web-sdk'; /* Callback for handling the event 'RAINBOW_ONREADY' */ var onReady = function onReady() { // Do something with the SDK is ready (e.g. user signed in) ... }; var onLoaded = function onLoaded() { rainbowSDK.initialize(\"your_application_ID\", \"your_secret_key\").then(function() { // Do something when the SDK is initialized ... }).catch(function() { // Do something if there is an issue in the initialization of the SDK ... }); }; /* Listen to the SDK event RAINBOW_ONREADY */ document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.RAINBOW_ONREADY, onReady) /* Listen to the SDK event RAINBOW_ONLOADED */ document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.RAINBOW_ONLOADED, onLoaded) /* Manually load the SDK */ rainbowSDK.load(); </script> </body> </html> Understanding errors The following errors can be received by your application: CodeDetailed CodeErrorDescription 401401100Request has some problems with basic authentication headerThe format of the application ID or secret key is not good.

A Bubble is a \"collaboration space\" where you can invite Rainbow users to discuss and share files together. This tutorial will explain in details how to create a new bubble, invite Rainbow users and discuss together. If the objects / models Call, Contact, Conversation aren't accessible in your non-AngularJS application (to access enums), you can get it with this: var Call = angular.element(document.querySelector('body')).injector().get('Call'); var Contact = angular.element(document.querySelector('body')).injector().get('Contact'); var Conversation = angular.element(document.querySelector('body')).injector().get('Conversation'); Creating a new bubble Creating a new bubble can be done using the API createBubble(). You have to provide a name and a description. Create a new bubble without history By default, when you create a bubble, newcomers do not see previous messages exchanged in that bubble before they join. Creating a new bubble without history can be done this way: var ownedBubble; /* Handler called when the user clicks on a contact */ rainbowSDK.bubbles.createBubble(\"My New Bubble\", \"The description of my bubble\").then(function(bubble) { ownedBubble = bubble; // Do something when the bubble has been created ... }).catch(function(err) { // Do something if there is a server issue when creating the new bubble ... }); Note: You can't create several bubbles with the same name. Create a new bubble with history An optional parameter can be used to specify if the newcomers have the possibility to get the old messages exchanged in the bubble before they join. This example creates a bubble with history. let ownedBubble; /* Handler called when the user clicks on a contact */ rainbowSDK.bubbles.createBubble(\"My New Bubble with history\", \"The description of my bubble\", true).then(bubble => { ownedBubble = bubble; // Do something when the bubble has been created }).catch(err => { // Do something if there is a server issue while creating a new bubble }); Optional parameters CreateBubble() method accepts a number of optional parameters. Here is the list of them all with a brief explanation: let strName = 'Bubble name' // The name of the bubble let strDescription = 'Bubble Description' // The description of the bubble let boolWithHistory = false // True to have full messages history for newcomers let disableNotifications=false // When set to true, there is no more notifications to be sent by a room in all cases with text body (user join/leave, conference start/end) let urlAvatar=null // The avatar URL or null (in case of invalid URL or image it may fail) let autoAcceptInvitation=false // Set to 'true' to automatically invite other users to the bubble (without asking them to accept the invitation) let ownedBubble; /* Handler called when the user clicks on a contact */ rainbowSDK.bubbles.createBubble(strName, strDescription, boolWithHistory, disableNotifications, urlAvatar, autoAcceptInvitation).then(bubble => { ownedBubble = bubble; // Do something when the bubble has been created }).catch(err => { // Do something if there is a server issue while creating a new bubble }); Inviting Rainbow users in a bubble Once the bubble is created, you have to invite users in order to be able to discuss with them. Users can't join a bubble directly. They must be invited by a moderator of that bubble to become a member. You can invite a Rainbow user as a member with Participant privilege which is the default case or with Moderator privilege. Inviting a new participant To invite a Rainbow user as a participant, add the following code: var invitationBubble; var contact = ... // A contact got using Contacts API /* Handler called when the user clicks on a contact */ rainbowSDK.bubbles.inviteContactToBubble(contact.id, ownedBubble).then(function(updatedBubble) { ownedBubble = updatedBubble; // Do something when the invitation has been sent successfully ... }).catch(function(err) { // Do something if there is a server issue when sending the invitation ... }); Members with participant privilege can only collaborate in the bubble: Sending and receiving messages Sending and downloading files Inviting a new moderator To invite a Rainbow user as a moderator, add the following code: var ownedBubble; var contact = ... // A contact got using Contacts API var asModerator = true; /* Handler called when the user clicks on a contact */ rainbowSDK.bubbles.inviteContactToBubble(contact.id, ownedBubble, asModerator).then(function(updatedBubble) { ownedBubble = updatedBubble; // Do something when the invitation has been sent successfully ... }).catch(function(err) { // Do something if there is a server issue when sending the invitation ... }); Members with moderator privilege can collaborate and administrate the bubble.

    "content": "DocumentationChatting with Rainbow usersLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Chatting with Rainbow users Using the Rainbow SDK for Web, you can send and receive messages to Rainbow users. This tutorial explains in details how to make it work. Steps To be able to reach someone by chat, you need to do the following steps: Get a reference to the Rainbow Contact object representing the person you want to join. Retrieve the associated Conversation object with that person or create a new one if it is the first interaction with that person. Send the message to that person. Manage the receipts. If the objects / models Call, Contact, Conversation are not accessible in your non-AngularJS application (to access enums), you can get it with this: var Call = angular.element(document.querySelector('body')).injector().get('Call'); var Contact = angular.element(document.querySelector('body')).injector().get('Contact'); var Conversation = angular.element(document.querySelector('body')).injector().get('Conversation'); Retrieving the contact object There are several possibilities in Rainbow to retrieve a Contact object associated to a person depending on the fact whether or not this person is in your network. The next paragraphs will describe the different methods. Getting a contact from your network If the person is in your network, when the Rainbow SDK is started, you can directly access him by using the following method: getContactById(). If the contact is not in your list, these methods will return null. If you want to iterate through your list of contacts, you can call the method getAll() that will return an array containing the entire list of contacts that are in your network. In the following code sample, imagine your app displays a hardcoded list of contacts with only a name, a photo and a Rainbow Id and when the user clicks on a contact in that list, you want to display the associated conversation for chatting with that person. The function onContactSelected is called with the id of the contact when the user pressed on a contact item in your list. So, from that, it is easy to get the associated Contact object. var selectedContact = null; /* Handler called when user clicks on a contact */ var onContactSelected = function(contactId) { selectedContact = rainbowSDK.contacts.getContactById(contactId) .then(contact => { // Do something with the retrieved contact object }) .catch(err => { // Search failed }); } Searching for a contact If the contact is not in your network, you have to send a request to Rainbow to retrieve it. Depending the information you have you can call different APIs: searchContactById() or searchContactByName(). The two first methods will return the contact or null if it is found and the last one will return potentially several contacts or an empty array. The difference between these methods and the methods seen for getting a network's contact is that searching a contact is an asynchronous task. We need to wait for the answer coming from the server, so these 3 methods here are Promise based methods. The previous code can be updated like that: var selectedContact = null; /* Handler called when the user clicks on a contact */ var onContactSelected = function(contactId) { selectedContact = rainbowSDK.contacts.getContactById(contactId); // Contact not found locally, ask to the server if(!selectedContact) { rainbowSDK.contacts.searchContactById(contactId).then(function(contact) { selectedContact = contact; if(selectedContact) { // Ok, we have the contact object ... } else { // Strange, no contact with that Id. Are you sure that the id is correct? ... } }).catch(function(err) { //Something when wrong with the server. Handle the trouble here ... });; } } Retrieving the conversation object Once we have the contact, the next step is easy, we just have to call the getConversationByContactId() API by passing the contact found previously. This method is asynchronous too. var associatedConversation = null; ... rainbow.conversations.getConversationByContactId(contactId).then(function(conversation) { associatedConversation = conversation; }).catch(function(err) { //Something when wrong with the server. Handle the trouble here }); The retrieved Conversation object will never be null because if there was no previous interaction with that person, a new conversation will automatically be created and returned. Getting the previous messages exchanged By default when receiving the conversation associated to a user and if it exists, you can display the latest message exchanged by accessing the property lastMessageText: ... var lastMessage = conversation.lastMessage; If you need the messages history (messages already exchanged with that person), you need to call the API getMessagesFromConversation() that takes the Conversation object as a parameter and the number of messages to retrieve. By default, you can get the last 30 messages. You can retrieve up to 100 messages at a time. If there is more messages, you need to call t"

Rainbow Knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide. Rainbow conceptDetails Sandbox platform for developersThis Rainbow platform is dedicated to developers. The Sandbox platform for developers is not connected to the Production platform and let developers be familiar with our APIs and SDKs. This platform uses different accounts. Production platformThis Rainbow platform is the official one with all Rainbow services and infrastructures enabling a high availability and accessibility all over the world.This is the platform you use to connect to our Rainbow applications. Preamble In order to better understand how to use the Rainbow Web SDK, here are some technicals points: Rainbow offers REST APIs. When you use the Rainbow Web SDK, you do not have to know how to call them. The Rainbow Web SDK offers methods that hide these API to simplify your work (the SDK calls them internally). Most of these REST APIs coming from Rainbow are asynchronous which means that the server's response do not come immediately. And to not block your application, the request do not wait for the answer to avoid UX issues. To simplify your work, most of the time, the SDK will use JavaScript Promise to let you build build asynchronous requests. If it is not possible, you will have to listen to events for handling late answers or notifications. With all that stuff, your application will be able to handle notifications such as incoming instant messages. If you are not familiar with JavaScript Promise, you can have a look to the example below to see how to implement a Promise based behavior. You can also spend time on the Stack Overflow or search others available tutorials. Once you are logged to Rainbow, a Websocket connection is opened between your application (in fact the SDK for Web) and Rainbow in order to receive notifications that come from people or things (e.g. phone devices, materials etc.). The SDK for Web defines a lot of events that you have to handle in your application to be notified when something happens. Look at the example below to know how to subscribe to these events. Sign in to Rainbow By default, when calling the method signin(), you will sign in to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers. So you need to have your Sandbox account enabled. If not, use the Rainbow API Hub to connect and to activate your Sandbox developer account. You will receive an email with your Sandbox credentials shortly. If you want to connect to the Rainbow Production platform, you have to use the API signinOnRainbowOfficial(). You can use your Rainbow credentials to connect. Before being able to sign in, you need to listen to the event RAINBOW_ONREADY to know when the SDK for Web is ready to be used. The following example works using jQuery to catch the event fired by the SDK. Note: Do not forget to add your application ID and secret key when using the method initialize(). In case you need more help, read the guide Injecting Id and secret key var onReady = function onReady() { var myRainbowLogin = \"login\"; // Replace by your login var myRainbowPassword = \"password\"; // Replace by your password // The SDK for Web is ready to be used, so you can sign in rainbowSDK.connection.signin(myRainbowLogin, myRainbowPassword) .then(function(account) { // Successfully signed to Rainbow and the SDK is started completely. Rainbow data can be retrieved. ... }) .catch(function(err) { // An error occurs (e.g. bad credentials). Application could be informed that sign in has failed ... }); }; // Listen when the SDK is ready document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.RAINBOW_ONREADY, onReady) } Listen to authentication events During the authentication step, some events are available. Here is the list of these events you could listen to know if your SDK has been correctly signed and started. ServiceEventValue (String)Description sdk.connectionRAINBOW_ONSIGNED\"signed\"Authentication of the user succeeds sdk.connectionRAINBOW_ONSTARTED\"started\"All SDK services have been started Event RAINBOW_ONSIGNED This event is fired as soon as the SDK for Web has signed successfully to Rainbow to let you retrieve your account information and token. This event is fired before the event RAINBOW_ONSTARTED. At this stage, the SDK for Web can not retrieve data nor invoke services. You have to wait either for the event RAINBOW_ONSTARTED or for the fulfillment of the signin() promise. Event RAINBOW_ONSTARTED This event is fired when the SDK for Web is connected to Rainbow (i.e. after calling the login API) and when all SDK services are ready to be used. This event is fired just before giving the hand to the application after calling the signin() method. At this stage, the SDK can retrieve data from Rainbow and invoke any services.

    "content": "DocumentationCreating audio and video conferencesLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Creating audio and video conferences You can use Rainbow SDK for Web to create a WebRTC-based audio and video multi-party conference. WebRTC is a technology allowing the developers to ensure a real-time communication (RTC) in the browser, should it be a peer-to-peer conversation or a multi-party conference. The goal of this tutorial is to show how easy it is to create and modify an audio and video multi-party conference by using Rainbow SDK for Web. By the end of this tutorial you will be able to: Create an audio and video conference; Use audio stream in your conference; Chat with up to 4 rainbow users using audio and video; Add and remove video streams from your conference; Finish or quit conference; Basic prerequisites In order to proceed to creating audio and video conferences, you would need a thorough understanding of the concepts like Rainbow Connection, Chatting with Rainbow Users or Chatting in Rainbow Bubbles. Shortly, you need to have your application ready and started. Make sure you can connect with your Rainbow accounts, search for contacts, check your browser capabilities (audio, video), etc. Introduction WebRTC call concept presented in the context of Rainbow SDK for Web can be divided into two parts. First one is a peer-to-peer (P2P) connection between two users. This connection is relatively simple to introduce and its idea is quite straightforward. In order to learn how to establish a P2P audio/video connection, read the chapter called Initiating audio and video calls. Second one is a multi-party conference which is the main topic of this tutorial. Checking if user has active conference sessions Rainbow SDK can handle one conference at a time. That means a user which has an active conference session can not start or join any other conference until he finishes (or quits) the existing one. You can check whether the user that is logged in has active conference session by using the function rainbowSDK.conferences.hasActiveConferenceSession() which returns a Boolean. This function is available at any time for the logged in users. //... somewhere in your code if (rainbowSDK.conferences.hasActiveConferenceSession()) { return true; // You are not able to start or join a web conference } else { return false; // You are free to start or join a web conference } The response gives you an important information as a user which has an active conference session can not start or join web conference. Creating a web conference To create a web conference, you need to call the following function: rainbowSDK.conferences.startOrJoinWebConference(bubble), and pass your existing bubble as the argument. startOrJoinWebConference() function returns a promise, so the example of the code would look like that: //... somewhere in your code rainbowSDK.conferences .startOrJoinWebConference(bubble) .then(bubbleWithWebConf => { // Everything went fine, WebRTC conference is launched bubble = bubbleWithWebConf; }) .catch(error => { // Something went wrong, handle the error }); Having a Bubble object is essential to be able to create a WebRTC conference using Rainbow SDK for Web. If you have not created a Bubble yet, please check our tutorial Chatting in Rainbow Bubbles. startOrJoinWebConference() function works both for the conference organizator (Bubble owner) as well as for the members of a Bubble who want to join the conference. Rainbow Web SDK will verify the user role and act accordingly. Listening to the conference events From this moment on you can start receiving the updates on the conferenceSession object. In order to listen to the change events you should use an event listener in your code. var onWebConferenceUpdated = function(event) { // do something with the conference object var conferenceSession = event.detail console.log(conferenceSession); }; //... somewhere in your code document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.conferences.RAINBOW_ONWEBCONFERENCEUPDATED, onWebConferenceUpdated) Event listener is passing a conferenceSession object to your function. You can use this object in order to get the informations about the current state of the conference. Consider it as the entry point to all the operations that you will later perform on your WebRTC conference application. All the important informations about the existing web conference will be passed through that object. It is quite important for many functions that you might potentially want to use in your application, so make sure you have this event listener included in your code. Also, do always keep the latest conferenceSession object for reference. In the following part of the tutorial you will find plenty of references to the conferenceSession object. Other ways of getting the conferenceSession object You can retrieve the conference object by passing conferenceId parameter to the function getConferenceSessionById(conferenceId). One of the ways of getting conferenceId string is lo"

Several demo applications to demonstrate how to use the SDK for Web library. An API documentation that describes the available APIs (that you can call from your application) and that contains some tutorials explaining the fundamentals parts. JavaScript SDK library There is no delivery of this file. See the Getting Started guide to understand how to load it. Note: The samples provided here load the SDK for Web library directly from our Rainbow cloud platform. THIS IS FOR DEMO ONLY AND NOT FOR A COMMON USE. We DO NOT recommend to do this way when developing your application and when releasing it to production. You need to follow the Getting Started guide and download a fixed version that you will need to support as for any other third party libraries you use. This is because sometimes some adaptations need to be done when upgrading to a new version. So, this can't be handled automatically. Samples In order to help you discover the Rainbow Web SDK, we have put in place several samples. Each sample can be downloaded. You can then easily look through the source code, adapt-it and finally launch locally. These samples are connected to the Sandbox platform by default so to log-in, you will need some accounts on this platform. Read the guide Managing tests accounts to have more information on how to create accounts on the Sandbox platform.

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Getting Started Welcome to the Rainbow Web Software Development Kit! The Rainbow Web SDK (Software Development Kit) is a pure AngularJS JavaScript library that works on all modern browsers from IE 11 to the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. Its powerful APIs enable you to create the best JavaScript applications that connect to the Rainbow Cloud Services. Getting started with Rainbow Web SDK could not be easier. By adding a single line to your existing JavaScript project, you will have access to the public API of the Rainbow Cloud Services. Rainbow Knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide. Rainbow conceptDetails RainbowAlcatel-Lucent Rainbow™ is a cloud-based, enterprise-grade, Unified Communication as a Service (UCaaS) and Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS) that connects people and systems EventsEvents are asynchronous messages or notifications that come from Rainbow when something related to your data happens. By listening to theses events, your application will be able to react and inform the user of these changes. MethodsMethods are all the SDK functions your application can call to enable Rainbow services such as initiating a WebRTC call, sending a file, etc. In most of the cases, Methods are asynchronous and follow the JavaScript Promise pattern. Preamble Well, well, well... Yet another JavaScript library or SDK... As if it was missing... Yes, but with this one, you will \"change the world and make it better\"! because it's amazing! With Rainbow Web SDK you have the potential to build your own social network, your own banking, hospitality or whatever app you want with audio and video as well as multi-party chat interactions between your users just by adding this library to your app! Take time to read this first tutorial to understand the basics and then deploy your imagination and your coding spirit to build your app! OS and browsers support The Rainbow Web SDK is based on jQuery and the AngularJS framework. The Rainbow Web SDK works on: Chrome stable channel and Chromium based browser (e.g. Opera) Firefox ESR and stable channel Microsoft Edge Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 Safari The Rainbow Web SDK is supported on Windows (starting from Windows 7) and MacOSX (Starting from 10.10). The Rainbow Web SDK can be integrated into any Web application (i.e.: React, Vue), browser extension or desktop application that embeds a Webview (e.g. QT application, Electron, nw.js). Some integration examples can be found on our Github. What is the Rainbow Web SDK? Rainbow Web SDK is a JavaScript library you have to use in order to connect and access Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow. Once loaded and initialized, you have access to the library by using the variable rainbowSDK. This library is divided in services that let you access tons of methods and connect your app to the Rainbow functionalities. For example, the rainbowSDK.webRTC is the service dedicated to WebRTC (audio/video calls). It will give you access to all the WebRTC available features that you can use. In that service you can use the method rainbowSDK.webRTC.callInVideo() to make a video call with another Rainbow user. To help you discover all the available services, you can have a look at the documentation accessible on the left side of this page. Additionally, each service offers a set of events that you can listen to be notified of asynchronous things (e.g. incoming WebRTC call, etc.) that could occur. Methods There are two kinds of methods: Those that deal with the Rainbow platform: For these APIs, a promise based object is returned in order to allow you to continue the execution of your code once the result of this API is known (good or not). Those that only do things on the client side: For these APIs, the result is returned synchronously. When you do not call the API with the right parameters, you always get a JSON result containing an error code and an error label that is much more explicit (...) /* Example of error code object */ { code: SDK.ERRORBADREQUEST, // -16 label: \"Parameter 'contact' can't be null or empty\" } Events Events are initiated from the library when something that comes from the server happens. They are asynchronous. It is not mandatory to listen to all the events that come from the server. Choose the right ones you need!

This tutorial will explain how to start a basic Rainbow Web application and use the Rainbow SDK as ES Module. You can learn more about modules from this article. If you wonder how to set up the development environment and basic application structure, you are in the right place. If you have already built an app, this article will reiterate through the fundamental app structure in case you got lost on the way. At the end of this tutorial you will have a working application that could be considered as a starting point for developing an app using Rainbow Web SDK. You will also get the basic notion of the key Rainbow Web SDK concepts. The goal is to keep it simple, therefore we will be using the basic folder structure and vanilla JavaScript. This will be less disturbing for the new developers and expose the Rainbow Web SDK features to the veterans. Set up your development environment Before you start using Rainbow Web SDK, you need to make sure you have installed the required software tools. Install Node.js and NPM Make sure you have installed Node.js and NPM on your computer by running the following commands: $ node --version > v12.14.1 $ npm --version > 6.14.1 If any of those commands does not return a version number, follow the installation guides (Node, NPM) Browser We will be using Chrome or Firefox to develop, but you can use any of the browsers supported by Rainbow Web SDK. Text editor Rainbow Web SDK is a JavaScript library, therefore you can use any text editor or IDE to develop your first project. Create your web application As mentioned above, the project is going to use a basic structure of a simple JavaScript application. We will need a basic HTML structure that would load all the necessary libraries. Go on and create a new folder. We recommend using command line tools. Open a shell console and execute the following commands: $ mkdir myFirstRainbowProject $ cd myFirstRainbowProject $ npm init -y Once finished, you should have your JSON file package.json filled with the information. This step is required to install the required NPM libraries. Install Rainbow Web SDK Now, it's time to install the Rainbow Web SDK library. The SDK for Web is available as an NPM package to make the installation and updates easier. To install it, execute the following command (make sure you navigate to your project folder first): npm i -S rainbow-web-sdk Once Rainbow Web SDK has been installed, your project directory should look like this: . ├── node_modules │ └── rainbow-web-sdk │ ├── src │ │ ├── rainbow-sdk.min.js │ │ └── vendors-sdk.min.js │ ├── LICENSE │ └── package.json └── package.json The Rainbow Web SDK has been added to your folder node_modules. This folder contains all the packages installed from NPM Installing a local Web server To test the basics of your application, you will need an HTTPS Web server. You can install an NPM library HTTP-Server by executing the following command: npm i -D http-server Create a /public folder If you're building a Web application without using tools like Grunt, Gulp, Brunch or Webpack or without using JavaScript framework like React, you need to manually create public directory. You can execute the following command: mkdir public Create your first HTML file We have installed all the basic libraries necessary to create a simple project. We can now focus on creating a HTML skeleton file that would hold our app intact. Open a shell console and execute the following commands: cd public touch index.html cp ../node_modules/rainbow-web-sdk/src/* . Loading the Rainbow Web SDK library Open the file public/index.html with your text editor of choice and add the following lines to load the Rainbow Web SDK library: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" /> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> <title>My First Rainbow Application</title> <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/4.5.9/es5-shim.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es6-promise/4.0.5/es6-promise.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/momentjs/2.15.1/moment-with-locales.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.7.5/angular.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"./vendors-sdk.min.js\"></script> </head> <body> <h1>Rainbow Hello World Application</h1> </body> </html> Rainbow Web SDK depends on some libraries that have to be loaded first like jQuery, moment and AngularJS.

    "content": "DocumentationInitiating audio and video callsLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Initiating Audio and Video calls Using Rainbow Web SDK, you can make audio and video calls towards your contacts thanks to WebRTC. This tutorial will help you understanding how it works and will give you the hints for adding the possibility in your application to communicate in audio and video successfully. You can also start a WebRTC Conference (or desktop sharing) in a given Bubble (only one at a given time). If you want to see how to use Rainbow Web SDK to create a simple conferencing application, please have a look at our public GitHub Repository: Rainbow Web SDK - WebRTC Sample. Rainbow Knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide. Rainbow conceptDetails A peerA peer is a participant of a call in a peer-to-peer call or in a conference call. A legA leg is a kind of media shared in a call. It can be: audio, video or sharing WebRTC Peer to Peer CallThis is a call between 2 users. One is the caller, the second is the callee or the recipient. WebRTC Conference callThis is a call between 2 or more users. An audio only CallAn audio only call uses only the microphone for dispatching the audio leg to the recipient. An audio and Video callAn audio and video call uses the microphone and a camera for dispatching both audio and video legs to the recipient. A sharing callA sharing call uses the screen or an application for dispatching a data leg to the recipient. The call can be initiated with or without an audio leg. The audio leg can be added during the call. Escalate to video callWhen in an audio call, you can decide at any time to add a video leg with your recipients. This mechanism is called an escalation (i.e. adding a new leg to an existing call). Be careful, this is not a mutual escalation. Each participant can decide to escalate or not on his own. Preamble Rainbow Web SDK allows to make audio video calls. To do so, the Web SDK relies on the WebRTC stack included in your compliant browser. The Web SDK supports one-to-one audio and video call and conference call. In order to be able to make an audio and video call between you and other recipients, you need: A compliant browser: At this time of writing only Firefox and Chrome browsers are supported by Rainbow Web SDK. Consequently, you have to use one of these browsers to make an audio and video call. HTTPS: In order to use Rainbow audio and video API, you need to serve your application using HTTPS. A negotiation server: A server for exchanging the audio and video negotiation part between all participants of the call. Rainbow will do it, you don't need to care about this part. A signaling protocol: To establish a call between two participants or several ones in a conference, a signaling protocol is used to allow each peer to negotiate all required parameters for exchanging correctly his audio and video legs with the others participants. Rainbow Web SDK integrates this protocol so that you have nothing to do on that part. Relay servers: Depending your network condition, a STUN server could be needed to allow your application to know how to be joined from Rainbow or from a recipient. An additional media relay server (TURN) could be needed for relaying the communication when there are blocking network elements (i.e. a firewall) between the users and between the users and Rainbow when in a conference. Rainbow has several TURN and STUN servers dispatched all around the world that will be used if needed. You don't need to care about this part. As you can see, the Web SDK provides you with all the complicated things you need: no signaling part to manage, no STUN or TURN server to deploy... Detecting your browser compatibility Rainbow Web SDK can help you checking if the browser can do WebRTC calls. Use the method canMakeAudioVideoCall() such as in the following code sample: /* Somewhere in your application... */ /* Call this method to know if your application can make audio and video call */ if(rainbowSDK.webRTC.canMakeAudioVideoCall()) { /* Your browser is compliant: You can make audio and video call using WebRTC in your application */ } else { /* Your browser is not compliant: Do not propose audio and video call in your application */ } This is the easier way to detect that your browser is compliant with WebRTC. But you can use your own code to do that by calling directly the WebRTC APIs. Once you know that your browser is compliant, you need to know if a webcam or at least a microphone is available in order to make audio or video call. Call the method hasACamera() and hasaMicrophone() to check the device detected by your browser. /* Somewhere in your application... */ /* Call this method to know if a webcam is detected */ if(rainbowSDK.webRTC.hasACamera()) { /* A webcam is available, you can make video call */ ... } else { /* No webcam detected */ ... } /* Call this method to know if a microphone is detected */ if(rainbowSDK.webRTC.hasAMicro"

Internally, JavaScript modules of the SDK are based on AngularJS Services, Models, etc... If your application is based on AngularJS 1.x too, this tutorial will describe how to integrate and use Rainbow Web SDK. If it's not the case either because your application is based on an other JavaScript framework or a more recent version of AngularJS, you have to read the guide Integrating JS frameworks. Preamble To be able to use our Rainbow SDK for Web in an AngularJS 1.x application you will need to follow the steps below: Install Rainbow Web SDK NPM package Load the SDK Start the SDK Initialize the SDK Subscribe to events Call methods Rainbow Knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide. Rainbow conceptDetails SDK loaderThe SDK Loader is an open-source library made by Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise. It helps loading the SDK for Web and all its dependencies in an AngularJS 1.x application. EventsEvents are asynchronous messages or notifications that come from Rainbow when something related to your data happens. By listening to theses events, your application will be able to react and inform the user of these changes. MethodsMethods are all the SDK functions your application can call to enable Rainbow services such as initiating a WebRTC call, sending a file, etc. In most of the cases, Methods are asynchronous and follow the JavaScript Promise pattern. Rainbow SDK for Web installation Open a shell console and execute the following command in your application directory (application root folder): $ npm install rainbow-web-sdk --save Then copy the files to a directory served by your Web server (e.g. public/). $cp ./node_modules/rainbow-web-sdk/dist/vendors-sdk.min.js <your_folder> $cp ./node_modules/rainbow-web-sdk/dist/rainbow-sdk.min.js <your_folder> $cp ./node_modules/rainbow-web-sdk/dist/loader-sdk.min.js <your_folder> Loading Rainbow SDK for Web In your AngularJS application, you can load SDK for Web by using our own loader. For more details, have a look to the guide Loading AngularJS applications In your entry HTML file (e.g. index.html), add the following script at the end of your <body> tag. This will get the SDK for Web loader from the Rainbow official cloud and load your configuration file. <!-- Add the following lines to your 'index.html' file --> <html lang=\"en\" ng-controller=\"sampleController\"> <body> ... <script src=\"<path_to_your_file>/loader-sdk.min.js\" data-main=\"./config.json\"></script> ... </body> </html> When the browser executes your HTML file, it will load your config.json file that has to be correctly filled. Once done, the SDK for Web, its dependencies and your application files that use the SDK will be loaded by the browser. Starting the SDK Using the loader, the SDK for Web is started automatically once the files have been loaded by the browser. From your application files (e.g. from your main controller), you can listen when this loading step is complete by adding these lines: /* In your controller file, add the following lines to depend on the SDK module */ var sample = angular.module(\"sample\", [\"sdk\"]); sample.controller(\"sampleController\", [ \"rainbowSDK\", function(sdk) { \"use strict\"; var onLoaded = function onLoaded() { // The SDK has been loaded successfully console.log(\"[DEMO] :: Rainbow SDK has been loaded!\"); }; // Listen when the SDK has been loaded successfully $rootScope.$on(sdk.RAINBOW_ONLOADED, onLoaded); } ]); Initializing the SDK Before you can call SDK methods, you need to initialize the SDK, by calling the method initialize() and listen to the RAINBOW_ONREADY event in order to be sure that the SDK has been started correctly. Simply add the following lines to your application: /* In your controller file, add the following lines to depend on the sdk module */ var sample = angular.module(\"sample\", [\"sdk\"]); sample.controller(\"sampleController\", [ \"rainbowSDK\", function(sdk) { \"use strict\"; var onReady = function onReady() { console.log(\"[DEMO] :: Rainbow SDK is ready!\"); }; var onLoaded = function onLoaded() { console.log(\"[DEMO] :: Rainbow SDK has been loaded!\"); sdk.initialize() .then(function() { console.log(\"[DEMO] :: Rainbow SDK is initialized!\"); }) .catch(function() { console.log(\"[DEMO] :: Something went wrong with the SDK...\"); }); }; $rootScope.$on(sdk.RAINBOW_ONREADY, onReady); $rootScope.$on(sdk.RAINBOW_ONLOADED, onLoaded); } ]); Calling the SDK methods Once your application has been loaded and initialized successfully, you can call Rainbow SDK methods by using the keyword sdk followed by a service name such as contacts or bubbles and a method like getContactById(). For example, you can initiate a webRTC call by using the method sdk.webRTC.callInVideo(Contact). Most of the time, methods are asynchronous and return a JavaScript Promise. Subscribing to SDK "

This tutorial helps you integrate the Rainbow SDK for Web in your own JavaScript environment. Preamble Integrating a JavaScript library into an existing Web application is not often an easy step and sometimes takes time. This tutorial is here to help you integrate our Rainbow SDK for Web library in your web site or web application to benefit from our Rainbow services. If you have never used our Rainbow SDK, the best way to start is to follow our Getting Started guide. Rainbow Knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understand this guide. Rainbow conceptDetails EventsEvents are asynchronous messages or notifications that come from Rainbow when something related to your data happens. By listening to theses events, your application will be able to react and inform the user of these changes. MethodsMethods are all the SDK functions your application can call to enable Rainbow services such as initiating a WebRTC call, sending a file, etc. In most of the cases, Methods are asynchronous and follow the JavaScript Promise pattern. Installation, loading and initializing Follow Hello World - ESM guide to find out how install, load and initialize Rainbow Web SDK. Calling SDK Methods Once your application has been loaded and initialized successfully, you can call Rainbow SDK methods by using the keyword rainbowSDK followed by a service name such as contacts or bubbles and a method name like getContactById(). rainbowSDK is a global variable accessible from everywhere in your application once you have bootstrapped the SDK. For example, you can initiate a WebRTC call by using the method rainbowSDK.webRTC.callInVideo(aContact). Most of the time methods are asynchronous and return a JavaScript Promise. Access to SDK Constants You can access Call and SDK constant directly from rainbowSDK object: let Call = rainbowSDK.Call; let SDK = rainbowSDK.SDK; Integrating the SDK for Web in React, Vue and Angular We have published several starter kits that can be downloaded from GitHub. You can use them to quickly start a new project using your framework of choice and the Rainbow SDK for Web. The source code of the starter kits can be downloaded from our GitHub.

    "content": "DocumentationInteracting with usersLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Interacting with users, bots and things Rainbow is called a relationship machine because by using our SDKs and APIs you can find users, bots and things, keep a link with each of them, make groups and interact with them in a unique way. Additionally, you can create privileged relations with them that let you access to information such as their availability. Doing so let you build a lot of scenarios and could help you knowing the best way to reach them. The Rainbow SDK for Web offers a lot of methods that will be covered in that guide to let you build and manage your relationships. Rainbow Knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide. Rainbow conceptDetails A contactA contact is a Rainbow user who is in the network of the connected user. The networkThis is the list of contacts with whom you are sharing mutually your availability such as your phone presence, you activity presence, etc... Network is empty by default and can grow by sending and accepting invitations to Rainbow users. This action is call joining the network. An invitationAn invitation to join the network is a request that can be sent to any Rainbow users who can be found by the search engine. An invitation can be accepted or declined.When accepted, the user is added to the network or other user and inversely. When declined, the request is discarded. A groupUsers in Rainbow can be gathered by defining groups. Groups allow to categorize and organize your relations, friends, colleagues, bots, connected things, etc. Preamble As indicated in the introduction, using Rainbow, you can interact with users, bots or things. Having an interaction means: Being able to discover any entities such a users, bots or things Being able to dialog actively with them for example by making a video call with an user or receiving an instant message from a bot Being able to keep a link to them (e.g. retrieving the conversation or creating groups) And being able to get passive information from them such as their connection presence, phone presence, etc.- which means having a privileged relation. The different kinds of interactions are described in the following paragraphs. Discovering Rainbow entities The first thing to do to interact with users is to be able to find them. This step can be done with the integrated search engine. The SDK for Web has several methods to let you search or get Rainbow users. Searching by name If you know the firstname or the lastname or just some part of those data, you can use the method searchByName(). Using it, you need to specify at least the beginning of the name or the first name. Try to give as much information as you have in order to avoid having too many results. Here is an example of using this method: rainbowSDK.contacts.searchByName(\"Jon Doe\", 10).then(function(usersFound) { if(usersFound.length > 0) { // At least one user has been found usersFound.forEach(function(user) { // Do something with each contact returned }); } else { // No contact returned } If you do not specify any values for the limit parameter, a maximum of 20 results will be returned. No more 1000 results can be returned. This is the common method when searching for a user or a bot. Searching by Id or by Jid If you know either the Rainbow id of the user or his jid, you can use the method searchById() or searchByJid() instead. These methods return the user if found or null elsewhere. rainbowSDK.contacts.searchById(\"5be9826de3bc5e54c13e00bd\").then(function(entityFound) { if(entityFound.) { // Do something with the entity found } else { // No entity returned } There are the common methods when searching for a bot or a connected thing. Interacting with users and things As mentioned previously, users or things are represented by the same structure that is a Contact. Once you have a Contact object representing a Rainbow user, a bot or a connected thing, you can use several methods to interact with. For example: For exchanging instant messages and files: Use the method openConversationForContact() from Conversations service. Once conversation is created or retrieved, you can send messages and files. For calling him in video: To initiate an audio or audio and video call, use the method callInAudio() or callInVideo() from the WebRTC service. For collaborating with him in Bubbles: Use the method inviteContactToBubble() from the Bubbles service to invite him to your bubble. For sending him notifications: Use the method addMembersToChannel() from the Channels service to add him to a channel. For calling him by phone: Use the method callByNumber() from the Telephony service to call him on his phone device. For keeping a direct link: Use the method addContactInGroup() from the Groups service to add him to one of your groups. See the next paragraph for more details on Groups. For sharing your presence Send an invitation to your network by calling the method addToNetwork"

    "content": "DocumentationLoading Angular 1.x applicationsLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Loading AngularJS 1.x applications In this tutorial, you will discover how to setup the config.json file right for loading the SDK for Web, its dependencies and your application files. This way of loading is designed to be used in AngularJS 1.x based applications only. If your application is based on an other JavaScript front-end framework like Backbone, React, Ember, jQuery or recent version of Angular, please have a look at the guide Getting Started; this tutorial will help you loading and using the SDK for Web in your specific environment. Preamble In order to propose an easy way for loading and configuring your application, we decided to remove the complexity from the index.html file by keeping only the minimum viable tags. All the others things (i.e. the list of files to load, the settings) will be loaded from a configuration file. Like explained in the previous tutorial, the first thing you have to do is to add the following lines to your HTML file: <!-- Add the following lines to your 'index.html' file --> <html lang=\"en\" ng-controller=\"sampleController\"> <body> ... <script src=\"/path_to_loader/loader-sdk.min.js\" data-main=\"./config.json\"></script> ... </body> </html> By default the file config.json will be used as your configuration file. You can rename it or load it from an other place. Do not forget to update the path! Note: As you can see, the 'ng-app' attribute that lets you bootstrap your application is no more needed (it will be defined inside the configuration file). Understanding the loading steps This configuration file is divided into several parts that are loaded one after the other in order to keep some logical order and avoid for example to load the applications file that depend on the SDK before it. There are 5 steps for loading your application: Step 1: Load the pre-requisites libraries: The first step is to load the libraries needed by the SDK. In most of the cases, you do not have to modify these parts except if you want to remove ones that you have already been loaded by your own Step 2: Load the SDK for Web: Once the prerequisites are loaded, the SDK for Web follows Step 3: Load the others libraries: There part can be empty or contains additional libraries that need to be loaded after the SDK for Web Step 4: Load the applications files: Once all of the \"framework\" part has been loaded, the applications files are loaded too Step 5: Bootstrap the application: Once all is loaded, the application is bootstrapped and then ready to start which means that your main controller is called (in case of an AngularJS application). The following paragraphs will focus on each of the steps above to help you understand and setup the configuration file. Discovering the configuration file Here is the content of the configuration file you need to have in order to load all your files correctly. You can copy and paste this config.json sample and adapt it to fit your needs. { \"libraries\": { \"prerequisites\": [ \"//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js\", \"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/momentjs/2.15.1/moment-with-locales.min.js\", \"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.7/angular.min.js\" // for Rainbow Web SDK versions > 1.53 use : \"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.7.5/angular.min.js\" ], \"sdk\": { \"official\": [ \"path_to_vendors_file/vendors-sdk.min.js\", \"path_to_rainbow_file/rainbow-sdk.min.js\" ], \"default\": \"official\" }, \"after\": [] }, \"app\": { \"bootstrap\": \"sample\", \"key\": { \"appID\": \"\", \"appSecret\": \"\" }, \"js\": [\"./src/js/sdkSampleApp.js\", \"./src/js/components/connection/connectionCmp.js\", \"...\"], \"css\": [\"src/styles/sdkSampleApp.css\", \"src/js/components/connection/connectionCmp.css\", \"...\"] }, \"settings\": { \"verboseLog\": true, \"disableCache\": true, \"enableLoader\": true } } Be careful when modifying the configuration file, it should be a valid JSON file (i.e. no comments). When you are modifying this file, you can open your browser developer console in order to see if all is correct (a lot of logs have been added to help you understand what is going on when something goes wrong). Loading the prerequisites The SDK for Web prerequisites are loaded first. As mentioned before, in most of the cases, you do not have to modify this part because if these files are not loaded first, the SDK for Web will not load and work correctly. { \"libraries\": { \"prerequisites\": [ \"//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js\", \"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/momentjs/2.15.1/moment-with-locales.min.js\", \"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.7/angular.min.js\" // for Rainbow Web SDK versions > 1.53 use : \"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.7.5/angular.min.js\" ], ... } ... } By default these files are loaded from a CDN. You can change the path if you want to load them from a local directory. If your application depends on an other third-party libraries, you can add them in this part. They will be loaded for you.

    "content": "DocumentationManaging FavoritesLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Managing Favorites Rainbow Web SDK allows you to store links to conversations with Users and Bubbles in a handy list called Favorites. Favorites are essentially a JavaScript array containing objects. Each of those objects the following properties: type - describing a type of a Favorite. Can be set either to user or bubble id - representing an ID of a Favorite peerId - a dbId property of a Bubble or User that is linked to Favorite object contact or room - essentially a contact or bubble object that is linked to Favorite item With those four you will have a good peak on what Users or Bubbles are the most used and essential for the application. Retrieving Favorites List You can retrieve Favorites List from the server by calling fetchAllFavorites() method that returns an Array. Favorites Array can be empty when no User or Bubble has been added to Favorites. It is an asynchronous method, therefore it returns a Promise containing the Favorites Array. // somewhere in your code rainbowSDK.favorites.fetchAllFavorites() .then(function (favorites) { // do something with the Favorites Array retrieved from the server }) .catch(function (err) { console.log (err) }) Creating a Favorite To create a Favorite (add a new object to the Favorites list), use the favorites.createFavorite() method which accepts a Bubble or User dbId and type as arguments. createFavorite() returns a Promise due to its asynchronous nature. A snippet below shows how to create a Favorite of each of the types: var user = UserObject; var bubble = BubbleObject; // Create a new Favorite from an User: rainbowSDK.favorites.createFavorite(user.dbId, \"user\") .then( // do something once the Favorite has been created ) .catch( // do something in case of an error ) // Create a new Favorite from a Bubble: rainbowSDK.favorites.createFavorite(bubble.dbId, \"bubble\") .then( // do something once the Favorite has been created ) .catch( // do something in case of an error ) Once a new Favorite is created, an event is going to be sent. Think of it as a confirmation of the successful Favorite creation process. // somewhere in your code: favoriteCreatedEventListener(event) { // event.detail contains an object of the freshly-created Favorite console.log(\"Favorite created\", event.detail) } document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.favorites.RAINBOW_ONFAVORITECREATED, favoriteCreatedEventListener) Deleting a Favorite Analogically, it is possible to delete a Favorite from the Favorites list by calling the favorites.deleteFavorite() method which accepts a Favorite ID string. It is asynchronous and it returns a Promise. var favorite = FavoriteObject; // Favorite Object // Delete a Favorite rainbowSDK.favorites.deleteFavorite(favorite.id) .then(// do something once the Favorite has been deleted) .catch(// do something in case of an error) Similarly to creating a Favorite, while deleting one, an event will be dispatched. It is a definite confirmation that a Favorite has been deleted. favoriteDeletedEventListener(event) { // event.detail contains an object of the freshly-created Favorite console.log(\"Favorite deleted\", event.detail) } document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.favorites.RAINBOW_ONFAVORITEDELETED, favoriteDeletedEventListener) Last updated April, 30th 2019 On this pageManaging FavoritesRetrieving Favorites ListCreating a FavoriteDeleting a FavoriteWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

    "content": "DocumentationOAuth2 authenticationLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21OAuth Authentication This tutorial shows how you can use OAuth 2.0 authentication method in your application. Rainbow uses OAuth 2.0 protocol to ensure authentication and authorization. One of the advantages of using OAuth 2.0 protocol is removing the responsibility for storing the user credentials from the third-party applications developers. Also, by outsourcing the authentication flow to Rainbow servers, the developers no longer need to maintain their own servers and ensure the application of numerous security measures. It also provides a set of advantages for the users who want to restrict the usage of their personal data linked to a Rainbow account. With OAuth 2.0 the users can also limit or even revoke the access of the third-party applications to their data. The main principle of OAuth 2.0 protocol is to separate the role of the client from that of the resource owner (Rainbow). Basic Concepts The basic idea behind the OAuth 2.0 is to ensure a protocol flow between the three (optionally four) principal roles explained in the context of Rainbow flow below: Resource owner - user providing an access to his data (protected resource) Resource server - Rainbow server hosting the protected resources Client - Third-party application trying to access resources on behalf of the Resource Owner Authorization server - Server which sends the authorization token to the Resource server Currently Rainbow Web SDK supports the so called Implicit flow which facilitates the authentication process for Single Page Applications written in JavaScript (or one of its frameworks). It excludes the necessity of involving an Authorization Server in the process. However, this approach has some limitations: the token is valid for only one hour. After that time it is required for user to run the sign in procedure again. Access token Access token is a string issued by Resource server (Rainbow server) to the Client (third-party application). It represents the authorization to access Resources. The end goal of the quite complicated OAuth 2.0 protocol process is to issue the token to the client and ensure secure access to the user data. Token replaces username and password by providing and abstraction layer. Therefore, once obtained, Access Token relieve the third-party applications from a duty of securing and keeping user data. Access token is a simplification of the idea of authentication, as it is represented by a single string understood by the Resource server. Requirements In order to use the benefits of OAuth 2.0 protocol in your application using Rainbow Web SDK, you need to follow the process of creating an application in our Rainbow for Developers. You will need two basic pieces of information: Application ID - ID of the application generated by Rainbow for Developers. Redirect URI - a URI of your choice that the user will be redirected to after giving a consent for your application to use his protected resources You can set Redirect URI either via Rainbow for Developers or Rainbow CLI. It is extremely important for the functioning of your application as our server will verify it each time a user will try to connect to Rainbow through your application. It is also the first and foremost layer of security granted by the Implicit flow. To set a redirect_uri attribute and assign it to your application, use rainbow-cli tool: rbw application set-redirecturi YOURAPPID YOURREDIRECTURI For more information on the application lifecycle, you can read the tutorial Application lifecycle. Implicit flow OAuth's implicit flow assumes that the Resource server can provide the protected resource based only on the Application ID. In order to use the implicit flow, you need to fully agree to all the security levels it proposes (see the part about security). To do so, go to rainbow-cli tool and run the following command in your shell: rbw application set-implicitgrant YOURAPPID You can revoke your application's authorization to use implicit flow by running the following command: rbw application unset-implicitgrant YOURAPPID To obtain the Authentication Token via the Implicit Flow, follow the steps below: Direct user to Rainbow authorization URL Your first action is to redirect a user to the Rainbow authorization page. In order to do so, you will need to build the redirect link that will consist of few mandatory parts: Rainbow Host URL - this parameter will always stay the same: https://RAINBOW_SERVER/api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/oauth/authorize? Response type - parameter defining the type of response. As above, this part will stay the same in all of your requests: response_type=token Application ID - this is the part when you need to provide your application ID in the following format: &client_id=YOURAPPLICATIONID Redirect URI - another parameter that will define and protect your application (see previous step): &redirect_uri=https://YOURREDIRECTURI State - a random string ge"

    "content": "DocumentationRetrieving calls historyLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Retrieving calls history In this tutorial, you will discover how to retrieve your call history. Each time you call a Rainbow user using audio or video from your mobile application, your browser or when you call someone using your phone connected to a PBX, a call log entry is generated and added to your call history. This tutorial will help you understand how to deal with these information and manage your call history. Preamble The call history is not limited to audio and video calls done from Rainbow. Each time someone calls you on your phone associated to your Rainbow user or when you call someone with your phone device registered on Rainbow, a call log entry is generated and saved on Rainbow. The call history of the connected user will contain all these call log items. Each entry will contain the following structure: { contact: \"318d07bcb19f449ba427b4672722b367@openrainbow.com\", // User JID or phone number contactDisplayName: \"Jon Smith\", contactInitials: \"JS\", date: Thu Dec 07 2017 14:15:56 GMT+0100 (CET), direction: \"incoming\", // Or `outgoing` duration: \"30m 45s\", // 0 for missed call id: \"web_83b73bc4-c22d-44ac-9c49-b83558231549\", read: true, // false if new (not marked as read) state: \"answered\", // Or `missed` type: \"webrtc\" // or `telephone` } Here are some information regarding the parameters in that structure: Regarding the property contact, if the recipient is a Rainbow user, this property will contain the JID information. So using this information you are able to find the associated Rainbow contact information. If the recipient is not a Rainbow user, you can have only a phone number. Regarding the property read. Its value equals to false if it is a new entry that has not been marked as read. Regarding the property state. Its value equals to answered if the call has been established or would be set to missed otherwise. Regarding the property type. Its value equals to webrtc if the call has been done with the computer or the mobile using the WebRTC technology or telephone otherwise (for a PSTN call). Regarding the property direction. Its value equals to incoming when this is a call from a recipient to the connected user or outgoing when the call has been established by the connected user. Retrieving the call history Once the SDK for Web has started, you can retrieve the log history of the connected user by using the API getAll. This operation is not synchronous so to be sure that all the history has been received, you need to listen to the event RAINBOW_ONCALLLOGUPDATED. Here is an example for retrieving the call history when started: var onCallLogUpdated = function onCallLogUpdated() { var logHistory = rainbowSDK.callsLog.getAll(); // Do something with the log history }; document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.callsLog.RAINBOW_ONCALLLOGUPDATED, onCallLogUpdated) The API isInitialized() can be used to check if the initial log history has been retrieved from Rainbow. A true value returned means that the whole call log has been retrieved from Rainbow. Listening to new call history entry The same listener on RAINBOW_ONCALLLOGUPDATED can be used to listen to new call log entry. This new entry will be automatically added to the history. Calling the API Managing call history counter Generally speaking, when a call is missed a new call log entry is added to the history with the property read equals to false. So, when you need to know how many calls you missed, you can use the API getMissedCallLogCounter() such as in the following: var missedCallCounter = rainbowSDK.callsLog.getMissedCallLogCounter(); The variable missedCallCounter will be a number that represents the number of missed calls. And then, using the API getAll(), you will be able to retrieve these calls. In order to decrease this counter, you will have to mark these logs 'as read' (described in the next paragraph). Mark a call history entry as read To mark as read an existing missed call entry, you need to call the API markCallLogAsRead(). var onCallLogAckUpdated = function onCallLogAckUpdated() { //Do something when an acknowledgement has been done on the call history ... } var entry = rainbowSDK.callsLog.getAll()[0]; rainbowSDK.callsLog.markCallLogAsRead(entry.id); document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.callsLog.RAINBOW_ONCALLLOGACKUPDATED, onCallLogAckUpdated) Once this has been done, a new event RAINBOW_ONCALLLOGACKUPDATED is fired to inform that at least an acknowledgement has been done on the call history. Calling the API getAll() will give you an update of the call history and the property read of the associated entry has changed to true. By calling the API getMissedCallLogCounter(), you should have a smaller result. Note: The API markAllCallsLogsAsRead() mark all missed call to read in one step. Deleting call history items You can delete a call history item at any time by calling the API deleteOneCallLog() var entry = rainbowSDK.callsLog.getAll()[0]; rainbowSDK.ca"

    "content": "DocumentationSharing filesLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Sharing files Using the Rainbow SDK for Web, you can share any kinds of files (Office documents, images, media, etc...) with a Rainbow user or by sharing it within a bubble. This tutorial will explain how to use the FileStorage service for sharing files in Rainbow. Rainbow Knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide. Rainbow conceptDetails Rainbow storageRainbow offers to each user a dedicated area where their files can be stored securely. QuotaEach user has a predefined files storage quota depending on his profile. Limits All files shared with others Rainbow users or within bubbles are stored on Rainbow until you decide to remove them. To avoid bad usages, we have introduced the limits To consult the exact limits concerning Rainbow Web SDK, visit this link Knowing the file sharing quota In order to know if you can share a new file, you can call the method getUserQuotaConsumption() rainbowSDK.fileStorage.getUserQuotaConsumption().then(function(quota) { // Do something with the quota }).catch(function(err) { // DO something if there is an error getting the quota }); The quota is a JavaScript Object containing the following properties: { \"feature\": \"FILE_SHARING_QUOTA_GB\", // Quota associated to the feature File Sharing \"currentValue\": 120439, // Current total size of files uploaded \"maxValue\": 1073741824, // Maximum of size allowed \"unit\": \"octet\" // Unit used } Each time you share a file with a user or within a bubble or when you remove a file from Rainbow, you can ask the method getUserQuotaConsumption() to have an update. Sharing a file with a Rainbow user When in a conversation with a Rainbow user, you can share a file by calling the method uploadFileToConversation(). If you get the file from the FileChooser or if you construct yourself the File object from a Blob, you can upload it as follow let contactIdToSearch = \"...\"; let blob = new Blob([\"body { background-color: yellow; }\"], { type: \"text/css\" }); let file = new File([blob], \"style.css\"); // Retrieve a contact by its id rainbowSDK.contacts.searchById(contactIdToSearch) .then(function(contact) { // Retrieve the associated conversation return rainbowSDK.conversations.openConversationForContact(contact); }).then(function(conversation) { // Share the file return rainbowSDK.fileStorage.uploadFileToConversation(conversation, file, \"My file style\"); }).then(function(message) { // Do something once the file has been shared }).catch(function(err) { // Do something in case of error }); Blob object can't be used directly. You need to convert it to a File as shown in the previous sample. Uploading a local file If you want to upload a local file from your computer, here is how to do it. First, create an input element of type file in your DOM: <input type=\"file\" id=\"fileUpload\"></input> Then handle the change event that will occur on the element above: /* Somewhere in your code */ let file; let inputElement = document.getElementById(\"fileUpload\"); inputElement.addEventListener(\"change\", handleFiles, false); function handleFiles() { console.log('A file has been chosen') file = inputElement.files[0]; } Once you retrieve your file element, you can inject it into Rainbow Web SDK method as in the following example: var contactIdToSearch = \"...\"; // Retrieve a contact by its id rainbowSDK.contacts.searchById(contactIdToSearch) .then(function(contact) { // Retrieve the associated conversation return rainbowSDK.conversations.openConversationForContact(contact); }).then(function(conversation) { // Share the file // Please note that \"file\" below represents a file that we have assigned to a \"file\" variable above return rainbowSDK.fileStorage.uploadFileToConversation(conversation, file, \"My message \"); }).then(function(message) { // Do something once the file has been shared }).catch(function(err) { // Do something in case of error }); When you share a file, you will get in return the Message object exchanged with your recipient as for sending a chat message. In this JavaScript object, the property fileId contains the id of the file that can be used to get the description of the file shared: { \"filename\": \"myFile.png\", // The file name and extension \"filesize\": 120439, // The file size \"mime\": \"image/png\", // The mime type of the file \"url\": \"https://...5256345rdada\" // The URL of the file } Sharing a file within a Bubble Sharing a file within a Bubble can be done as simply as with a contact by calling the method uploadFileToBubble(). You can use either a path to your file as in the following sample or a File object. var bubbleId = \"...\"; var file = { /* Your file object that you have retrieved as above */ } // Retrieve the bubble var bubble = rainbowSDK.bubbles.getBubbleById(bubbleId); rainbowSDK.fileStorage.uploadFileToBubble(bubble, file, \"My message \"); }).then(function(message) { // Do something once the file has been shared }).catch(function(err) { // Do somehti"

It is however possible to develop a special version depending on the needs of your project. Please contact your Rainbow representative in order to discuss the details. The details below represent a helpful hints on how to provide the absolute minimum to ensure Internet Explorer 11 capabilities to run special Rainbow Web SDK version tailored for your needs. Adding ES6 compatibility Internet Explorer 11 doesn't support recent standardized specification released in ECMAScript 6 (ECMAScript 2015) like JavaScript Promise implementation, Array advanced methods etc. Consequently, the Rainbow Web application is not compliant with that browser. Regarding the SDK for Web, the compatibility can be provided by adding some extra libraries (aka ECMAScript shim) in your HTML file that are loaded before the SDK for Web. You need to add the following lines in your HTML file: <!-- Add the following lines to your 'index.html' file --> <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html lang=\"en\" ng-controller=\"sampleController\"> <head> <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/4.5.9/es5-shim.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es6-promise/4.0.5/es6-promise.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/promise-polyfill@8/dist/polyfill.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/string.prototype.startswith@0.2.0/startswith.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jspolyfill-array.prototype.findIndex@0.1.0/findIndex.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.6.15/browser-polyfill.min.js\"></script> </head> </html> Here's an explanation of what those libraries actually do: es5-shim and es6-shim will provide the compatibility with the Internet Explorer 11 by offering all the missing JavaScript features. polyfill for adding Promise polyfill startswith is needed to provide String.prototype.startsWith (if needed) findIndex is needed to provide Array.prototype.findIndex (if needed) Feel free to use your own shim/polyfill if your project needs them. Example for sending a file, for example in a Bubble, thanks to Esben from the Forum As IE11 doesn't support File creator (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) an existing way is to use a XMLHttpRequest() to download it function blobToFile(theBlob, fileName) { //A Blob() is almost a File() - it's just missing the two properties below which we will add theBlob.lastModifiedDate = newDate(); theBlob.name = fileName; return theBlob; } function insertImageInBubble(ownedBubble) { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(\"GET\", \"https://url.to/image.jpg\"); xhr.overrideMimeType(\"image/jpeg\"); xhr.responseType = \"blob\"; //force the HTTP response, response-type header to be blob xhr.onload = function () { var myFile = blobToFile(xhr.response, \"image.jpg\"); rainbowSDK.fileStorage.uploadFileToBubble(ownedBubble, myFile, \"Demo image\"); } xhr.send(); }; WebRTC audio and video limitation When using Internet Explorer 11, you can't access to Rainbow audio and video services based on WebRTC. When calling these methods from the Rainbow SDK for Web, you will receive a JSON error message explaining that this feature is not supported by your browser. Here is the list of methods not supported on IE 11: WebRTCService: callInAudio() WebRTCService: callInVideo() WebRTCService: answerInAudio() WebRTCService: answerInVideo() WebRTCService: showLocalVideo() WebRTCService: hideLocalVideo() WebRTCService: showRemoteVideo() WebRTCService: hideRemoteVideo() WebRTCService: escaladeToVideoCall() WebRTCService: reverseToAudioCall() WebRTCService: muteAudioCall() WebRTCService: muteVideoCall() WebRTCService: unmuteAudioCall() WebRTCService: unmuteVideoCall() Last updated October, 23rd 2019 On this pageSupporting IE11Adding ES6 compatibilityExample for sending a file, for example in a Bubble, thanks to Esben from the ForumWebRTC audio and video limitationWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

    "content": "DocumentationUsing ConfigLTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21Using Config Rainbow Web SDK configuration allows the developers to provide a more fine-grained experience to their users. It is also enabling the customization of the project that uses the SDK. This article covers two basic ways of Rainbow Web SDK configuration Method 1: Config File While loading the SDK, you can pass a JavaScript object as an argument. Here's a quick snippet demonstrating the usage of the config object: const rainbowConfig = { verboseLog: false, // Turn on/off all the logs linked to the SDK measurePerformance: false, // Add performance measurement points while loading the SDK videoQuality: \"1080p\", // Chose default broadcasted video quality credentials: { appID: \"\", appSecret: \"\", host: \"openrainbow.com\" }, // use the credentials logs: { // use fine-grained logs control (verboseLog needs to be true) contactService: true, // set to false to block all contactService logs xmppMessages: true, // set to false to block all XMPP messages xmppService: true, // set to false to block xmppService logs conversationService: true, // set to false to block conversationService logs presence: true, // set to false to block presence logs } } rainbowSDK.load(rainbowConfig); The presented structure of rainbowConfig object above is loaded by the SDK by default. If you want to keep all the properties as they are, but change one - for instance verboseLog - you can just mention only verboseLog in the config object: const rainbowConfig = { verboseLog: true } rainbowSDK.load(rainbowConfig); Method 2: Config Service You can also use ConfigService provided by Rainbow Web SDK, please have a look at the documentation of the service to find out what APIs are available with more details on the implementation.

    "content": "DocumentationConfigureLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22Configure SDK We now have a functional buildline and project, we need to configure and start the SDK framework. Before we can use the SDK, we need to create/declare our application in the Rainbow ecosystem. In this guide, for the moment, we simply want to create a test application. Rainbow offers a working platform dedicated to this kind of application: the sandbox platform. Let's see how to create such an application. 😱 Painful stage This part is a bit long and tedious but don't worry, we'll guide you through it and you only have to do it once. Step 1: Create a user account on rainbow If you're reading this guide, you probably already have a Rainbow user account. If not, please create one here: Create a Rainbow account Step 2: Log-on the developpers site and register as developper With your Rainbow credentials, log on to the developers website If this is the first time you've logged on, or if you haven't done so yet, you will be asked to register as a developer. Thank you for completing this process. Congratulation: You are now register as Rainbow developper, welcome to our familly Step 3: Create your sandbox environment It's now time to create your sandbox environment. To do this, on the developer site, in the left-hand menu, click on the sandbox entry. You will receive your sandbox credentials by e-mail, please check your e-mails Sandbox Rainbow URL: https://web-sandbox.openrainbow.com Your developer account : your@email.com Your developper password : xxxxxxxxxx Sandbox APIs address: https://openrainbow.com Step 4: Connect to the developper sandbox site If you go back to the \"developpers\" site, in the sandbox section, you can now connect by clicking on the small icon at the top right of the right-hand panel 😖 You need to log in using the password you received in your e-mail! Once you've done this, you should (finally) see the sandbox application creation menu appear 😥 Step 5: Create your test application Click on the \"Create application\" button to create your sandBox application You will be redirected to your new application settings page. 🧭 INFORMATION This is where you'll find all the information we need to configure our SDK, in particular the applicationID and the secretKey. To use the SDK you need an applicationID and a secretKey. These information allow you to identify your application and to use the Rainbow platform. For more information, see Applications lifecycle which explains what is the purpose, how to create an application and how to get the applicationID and the secretKey. The serverHostname is also necessary to know which server is used in our case and for the moment the sandbox. In the sandbox case, the serverHostname is 'sandbox.openrainbow.com' Step 6: Configure the SDK First, we have to create an instance of the Rainbow SDK in our test application. To do this we will modify the index.ts file: import { RainbowSDK } from 'rainbow-web-sdk'; class TestApplication { protected rainbowSDK: RainbowSDK; constructor() { this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ appConfig: { server: 'serverHostname', applicationId: 'applicationId', secretKey: 'secretKey' }, plugins: [], autoLogin: true, logLevel: LogLevelEnum.WARNING }); } } const testApplication = new TestApplication(); We pass the following object to the RainbowSDK { appConfig: { server: 'serverHostname', applicationId: 'applicationId', secretKey: 'secretKey' }, plugins: [], autoLogin: true, logLevel: LogLevelEnum.WARNING } This will configure our SDK object with our application information: appConfig: serverHostname is the server used, in our case: \"sandbox.openrainbow.com\". applicationId and secretKey are your credentials created in step 5. plugins is an array that will allow you to add features to our SDK through a plugin mechanism. This mechanism will embed and start only the necessary features (and not a whole bunch of useless functionalities). autologin specifies if the SDK will try to automatically connect to the server if an existing auth token is found locally. logLevel specifies the logLevel. 💡 Tips The RainbowSDK is the entry point of the SDK and is a singleton object: it will be created only once ! If you need to get this singleton anywhere in your application, just use the static getInstance() method: this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.getInstance(); Step 7: Start your app It is now time to start your app and check if the RainbowSDK is well loaded and started ! $ npm run build $ npm run serve PMA: LOPACOMPRI Then reload you browser and this the expected result You can check the state of the Rainbow SDK from the console. Continue to Connection On this pageStep 1: Create a user account on rainbowStep 2: Log-on the developpers site and register as developperStep 3: Create your sandbox environmentStep 4: Connect to the developper sandbox siteStep 5: Create your test applicationStep 6: Configure the SDKStep 7: Start your appWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright -"

    "content": "DocumentationConnectionLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22Create and connect user Now that Rainbow is alive in our application we have to try to authenticate a user. We already have a user on the SandBox platform: you! But let's see how to quickly create test users. Two important pieces of information: When you have created your developer account on sandbox, the user that has been created has administrative rights. That is to say that it has the possibility of creating Rainbow users manually. Moreover, in Rainbow, users are attached to a company. When your user was created, a company was also created. We are going to create our test users in this company! 😱 Another tedious step But as previously, just do do once ! Step 1: Access the Rainbow administration interface First, connect to the SandBox platform (step 4 of the previous guide). Remember, you have to use the login/password you have received via e-mail And reach the following site: Connect to the SandBox platform Once connected click on this icon on the Rainbow left action bar: (It's not obvious but it is the administration icon 😁). This will open the Rainbow administration interface: specifically, your company dashboard! Click on the to access the administration of your company and its users. Finally click on the members icon You now see the list of members of your company appear, which at this stage should only contain one member: you! The button at the top right of this list allows you to create users. To save time, we invite you to immediately create 3 users who will be useful to us later: Alice, Bob and Carole. 💡 NOTE When creating a user you will be asked for an email address. It is not necessary for these three users to have \"real\" email addresses, so you can invent one (no confirmation email sent).Likewise, no matter what names you give them, just know that in the rest of this guide, we will identify them by Alice, Bob and Carole Step 2: Connect SDK with Alice How to proceed ? The rainbowSDK object carries the connection object which handles all Rainbow connection stuff (it manages connection/disconnection, network loss/retrival, ...) First, we will add a listener to this connection object // Subscribe to connection object events (only RAINBOW_ON_CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE events) this.rainbowSDK.connection.subscribe((event: RBEvent) => { this.connectionStateChangeHandler(event); }, ConnectionServiceEvents.RAINBOW_ON_CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE); // Declare a simple event handler (just log events in the console) private connectionStateChangeHandler(event: RBEvent): void { const connectionState: ConnectionState = event.data; console.info(`[testAppli] onConnectionStateChange ${connectionState.state} ${connectionState.reason}`); } With this code, we can now be informed of the rainbow connection status. Now we will try to authenticate on the Rainbow platform. To do this, we're going to use the this.rainbowSDK.start method. This return the connected user when connection success. If the connection fails, then call the this.rainbowSDK.connectionService.logon with the previous credentials. Suppose that Alice has as for login (her email address) and password the following information: login: 'alice.test@drabedroc.fr' password: 'AlicePassword' let userConnected: ConnectedUser = await this.rainbowSDK.start(); if (!userConnected) { try { userConnected = await this.rainbowSDK.connectionService.logon('alice.test@drabedroc.fr', 'AlicePassword', true); } catch (error: any) { this.rainbowSDK.logger.error(`[testAppli] ${error.message}`); return; } } console.info(`[testAppli] connected with user ${userConnected.displayName}`); All together now: import { ConnectionServiceEvents, ConnectionState, ConnectedUser, RBEvent, RainbowSDK } from 'rainbow-sdk'; class TestRainbowSDK { protected rainbowSDK: RainbowSDK; public async init(): Promise<void> { this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ appConfig: { server: 'sandbox.openrainbow.com', applicationId: 'yourApplicationId', secretKey: 'yourSecretKey' }, plugins: [], autoLogin: true, logLevel: LogLevelEnum.WARNING }); this.rainbowSDK.connectionService.subscribe((event: RBEvent) => this.connectionStateChangeHandler(event), ConnectionServiceEvents.RAINBOW_ON_CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE); let userConnected: ConnectedUser = await this.rainbowSDK.start(); if (!userConnected) { try { userConnected = await this.rainbowSDK.connectionService.logon('alice.test@drabedroc.fr', 'AlicePassword!', true); } catch (error: any) { console.error(`[testAppli] ${error.message}`); return; } } console.info(`[testAppli] connected with user ${userConnected.displayName}`); } private connectionStateChangeHandler(event: RBEvent): void { const connectionState: ConnectionState = event.data; console.info(`[testAppli] onConnectionStateChange ${connectionState.state}`); } } const testRainbowSDK = new TestRainbowSDK(); testRainbowSDK.init(); And now check the results Congratulation, your application is now connected to Rainbow with the user 'alice.test@drabedroc."

    "content": "DocumentationInstallationLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22Install SDK Requirements Before you start using Rainbow Web SDK, you need to make sure you have installed the required software tools. - Node.js and NPM: Make sure you have installed Node.js version 18.18.2 or above. $ node --version v18.18.2 💡 Tips You can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed. - A big browser: We will be use Chrome browser to develop (best debug tools), but you can use any of the browsers supported by Rainbow Web SDK. - A clever text editor: Rainbow Web SDK is a JavaScript library, therefore you can use any text editor or IDE to develop your first project (but our favorite editor is Microsoft Visual Studio Code). Create your web application As mentioned above, the project is going to use the structure of a simple JavaScript application. We will need a basic HTML structure that would load all the necessary libraries. Go on and create a new folder. We recommend using command line tools. Open a shell console and execute the following commands: $ mkdir myFirstRainbowProject $ cd myFirstRainbowProject $ npm init -y Once finished, you should have your JSON file package.json filled with the information. This step is required to install the mandatory NPM libraries. Patch your package.json To allow your project to load ES modules you have to patch the newly created package.json Just add the line \"type\": \"module\", { \"name\": \"myfirstrainbowproject\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"description\": \"\", \"main\": \"index.js\", \"type\": \"module\", \"scripts\": { \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\" }, \"keywords\": [], \"author\": \"\", \"license\": \"ISC\" } Install and configure a module bundler : Rollup Our SDK is delivered as an EcmaScript Module (ESM), to unleash the full power of ESM module you have to use a module bundler to bundle your application. In this example we will use the Rollup module bundler, but you are free to use any modern module bundler (webpack is also a good candidate for example). Rollup is easy to use and configure! 🤔 According to their authors: Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. ES modules let you freely and seamlessly combine the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. So, it's easy! Let's install Rollup: $ npm install rollup --global $ npm install rollup-plugin-typescript2 --save-dev $ npm install @rollup/plugin-node-resolve --save-dev $ npm install serve --save-dev $ npm install rollup-plugin-copy --save-dev With the previous commands we have installed: The Rollup bundler The typescript Rollup plugin (Because we are in 2024 and that we refuse to code in JS 😅) The node Rollup plugin (To permit bundle to access the libraries stored in the node_modules directory) The mini HTTP server (serve) that we'll use to serve our application The Rollup copy plugin to copy static files in dist directory Now add the Rollup config file at the root of the project rollup.config.js: import typescript from \"rollup-plugin-typescript2\"; import copy from 'rollup-plugin-copy'; import nodeResolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve'; const config = [ { input: './src/index.ts', output: { file: './dist/index.js', format: 'esm', sourcemap: 'true' }, plugins: [ nodeResolve(), typescript({ useTsconfigDeclarationDir: false }), copy({targets: [{ src: ['./src/index.html'], dest: './dist' }]}) ] } ]; export default config; Open your package.json file and add the \"build\" and \"serve\" line in you script entry \"scripts\": { \"build\": \"rollup -c rollup.config.js\", \"serve\": \"serve ./dist\", } The \"build\" command will execute the Rollup bundler. The \"serve\" command will start a local HTTP server on your computer to serve our test application. ** Finally add a minimal tsconfig.json configuration file { \"compilerOptions\": { \"module\": \"ESNext\", \"target\": \"es2019\", \"moduleResolution\": \"node\" } } Install the Rainbow Web SDK Now, it's time to install the Rainbow Web SDK library. The SDK for Web is available as an NPM package to make the installation and updates easier. To install it, execute the following command at the root of your project. $ npm install rainbow-web-sdk@5.0.0-beta.3 The Rainbow Web SDK has been added to your folder node_modules. This folder contains all the packages installed from NPM. Create the index.html and index.ts root files First create the src directory (make sure you navigate to your project folder first): $ mkdir src And then put these two files in the newly created src directory: index.html: <html> <head> <!-- 🤔 Note: in the next line .js extension is not a typo --> <script type=\"module\" src=\"./index.js\"></script> </head> <body> It works !! </body> </html> index.ts: import { RainbowSDK } from 'rainbow-web-"

    "content": "DocumentationGetting StartedLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22Getting started with the Rainbow Web SDK v2 Welcome We are pleased to present our (new) Rainbow Web Software Development Kit (SDK) for the Rainbow platform. It's a total rewriting from Rainbow SDK v1, taking advantage of new technologies and with a completely modernized toolchain. With this SDK you have the potential to build your own social network, your own banking, hospitality or whatever app you want with audio and video as well as multi-party chat interactions between your users just by importing this library to your app! Take time to read this first tutorial to understand the basics and then deploy your imagination and your coding spirit to build your app! A new SDK for the Rainbow platform? But why? Wasn't the old SDK great? Well, no! The old Rainbow SDK wasn't all that great! It had some serious drawbacks: No ESM support: SDK v1 is only distributed as a CommonJS library, when building an application with the SDK v1 your need to embeed the complete library. No TypeScript support: the SDK v1 was a pure Vanilla JS library, no type were provided. Not framework agnostic: the SDK v1 was based on the angularJS framework, and you have to embedded angularJS in your project event if you don't use it. Poor API design and documentation: the SDK v1 API are often difficult to use and to understand. 😖 WARNING After v2's official release, we highly encourage you to use Rainbow SDK v2 rather than Rainbow SDK v1, as Rainbow SDK v1 will be deprecated. If you've already developped an application with SDK v1, the migration strategy will be explain here. Now it's time to getting started Getting started with Rainbow Web SDK could not be easier. By adding a single line to your existing JavaScript project, you will have access to the public API of the Rainbow Cloud Services. This guide explains how to set up your Rainbow SDK v2 project. It includes information on prerequisites, installing, and optionally starting a sample example in your application to verify your setup.

    "content": "DocumentationBubblesLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22Bubbles plugin Using the Rainbow SDK for Web, you can have discussions and share files with several persons in a \"private\" area called a Bubble. A Bubble is a \"collaboration space\" where you can invite Rainbow users to discuss and share files together. This tutorial will explain in details how to create a new bubble, invite Rainbow users and discuss together. Please note that the BubbleService is not part of the Rainbow core service and is available via the BubblePlugin. The first thing to do is to add the bubble plugin to our project. Add the BubblePlugin in our project import { BubblePlugin } from 'rainbow-web-sdk/lib'; ... this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ host: { server, apiClientKey, appModuleKey }, plugins: [ BubblesPlugin ], autoLogin: true }) The BubbleService is the entry point for all bubble manipulations. import { BubbleService } from 'rainbow-web-sdk'; ... constructor() { this.sdk = RainbowSDK.getInstance(); this.bubbleService: BubbleService = this.sdk.bubbleService; } BubbleService API Now let's look at how to create and to access to the existing bubbles. Here are the main BubbleService methods: subscribe createBubble getBubbles getMyBubbles getBubbleInvitations searchBubbles In this section we'll also look at how to listen for bubbleService events. Listening bubbleService events To be informed of bubbleService modification you can subscribe to bubbleService events: const bubbleServiceSubscription = this.bubbleService?.subscribe((event: RBEvent) => { switch(event.name) { case BubbleServiceEvents.ON_SERVICE_STARTED: ... break; case BubbleServiceEvents.ON_NEW_BUBBLE_CREATED: ... break; case BubbleServiceEvents.ON_INVITATION_RECEIVED: ... break; case BubbleServiceEvents.ON_MY_USER_STATUS_UPDATE: ... break; case BubbleServiceEvents.ON_USER_STATUS_UPDATE: ... break; default: break; } }); Creating a new bubble Creating a new bubble can be done using the API createBubble(). You have to provide a name and a bubbleData. By default, when you create a bubble, newcomers do not see previous messages exchanged in that bubble before they join. Creating a new bubble with history can be done this way: // Create the bubble CreateBubbleData object // Please see API documentation to know all the available parameters // The following CreateBubbleData will create a bubble with a topic and with history const bubbleData: CreateBubbleData = { topic: 'My bubble with history', noHistory: false }; const bubble: Bubble = await this.bubbleService?.createBubble('MyBubble', bubbleData); Get existing bubbles There are two simple ways of finding bubbles you belong to: getBubbles and getMyBubbles. Let's see how to use them: // Get all bubbles you belong to (The bubbles you own and the bubbles in which you participate) const allBubbles: Bubble[] = this.bubbleService?.getBubbles(); // Get all bubbles you own const myBubbles: Bubble[] = this.sdk.bubbleservice?.getMyBubbles(); Get invitations to join a bubble Invitation to join a bubble is in fact a bubble with the specific status : BubbleUserStatus.INVITED. The API 'getBubbleInvitations' permits to fetch such invitation. const bubbleWhereIAmInvited: Bubble[] = this.bubbleService?.getBubbleInvitations(); We'll see later how to accept or decline a bubble invitation. Search for bubbles The API searchBubbles allows to search for bubbles that match a search criteria applied on some name properties such as The name of the bubble The name of some tag(s) set for the bubble The name of bubble participants. One or more name properties can be optionally specified to be used as scope for the search. If no scope is specified, the search is performed by default on the name of the bubble only. The search is performed in all bubbles visible to you, i.e. those you own and the bubbles in which you participate. As a result, it is possible to specify the sorting order of the bubbles found. By default, the list of bubbles is sorted by name. What do I receive in response to my search request? An array of bubbles (as Bubble) matching the search criteria. If no bubble has been found, an empty array is returned. For each bubble returned, information indicating how it was found (for example, by its name). Note that a bubble can be found in more than one way at a time (for example, by its name and the name of a tag). BubbleSearchResult interface implements the list of data provided as the result of a search for bubbles. // Search for bubbles with the name 'kate' or with a participant with this name // Returned list is sorted by date of last activity const bubbleSearchOptions: SearchBubblesOptions = { scope: [SearchBubblesScope.SEARCH_BY_TAG_NAME, SearchBubblesScope.SEARCH_BY_PARTICIPANT_NAME], sortBy: SearchBubblesSortBy.SORT_BY_LAST_ACTIVITY }; const searchBubblesResult: BubbleSearchResult[] = await this.bubbleService.searchBubbles('kate', bubbleSearchOptions); Bubble API Now let's look at how to administer your newly created bubble.

    "content": "DocumentationCallLogLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22CallLog plugin What are call logs ? Rainbow automatic collects and stored details of incoming and outgoing audio/video calls and conference calls. This feature is referred to as Call Logs and available via the CallLogService. 💡 Note The CallLogService does not cover voice messages retrieval and management. What Data are present in Call Logs? Some of the call details recorded in call logs reports are: Call date Calling or Called party's number Call duration Call direction (incoming or outgoing) Call state (answered, missed or forwarded) Call type (webrtc, telephone, conference) Call subject All this information may not be available at the same time for a given call log. For example, the call subject is optional and only concerns Rainbow audio/video calls. And for a missed call, the call duration is not relevant. In addition to the information linked to a call itself, each call log contains additional information enabling it to be managed such as marking it as read or deleting it: A unique identifier A read status The User reference object instance associated to the calling/called party's number (To access its contact card for example) How retrieving Call Logs? Unlike other services, for performance reasons, the CallLogService does not automatically make available the call logs associated with the connected user. Consequently, the CallLogService must first be explicitly initialized (initCallLogs) to enable retrieval of the first most recent call logs. This initialization step is mandatory, but only needs to be performed once. If not done, no call logs will be available and some APIs offered by the CallLogService to retrieve and manage call logs will not be functional (an error will be thrown). Then, additional older call logs can be retrieved on explicit request (getNextCallLogs). The number of call logs to be retrieved can be specified for each operation. In both cases, the recovered call logs will automatically be stored in what we'll call the call logs history. In addition to call logs retrieved on demand (service initialization, additional requests), the call logs history can evolve with the addition of new call logs resulting from calls made or received after the service initialization step. In this case, the event ON_CALLLOG_UPDATED is sent to notify about the call logs history update. The contents of the current call logs history can be retrieved at any time, using the getCallLogs API. Counters are also available for tracking call logs: The total number of call logs associated with the logged-in user (getCallLogsCounter). The event ON_CALLLOG_TOTAL_NUMBER_UPDATED is sent to each time this counter is updated. It is important to point out that this counter differs from the number of call logs already present in the call logs history. The number of missed calls (getMissedCallsCounter). The event ON_CALLLOG_MISSEDCALLS_COUNTER_UPDATED is sent to each time this counter is updated. How managing Call Logs? Features are available to manage call logs individually or globally. Mark call log(s) as read The 'mark as read' operation only concerns call logs already present in the call logs history. This operation can be performed on one specific call log or on all call logs. Deletion of call log(s). A call log can be individually deleted if its is present in the call logs history. It is also possible to delete all the call logs associated with a user reference (Representing the calling and called party) , or even all the call logs of the connected user. In the latter two cases, all the call logs concerned will be deleted, whether or not they are present in the call logs history. Please note that the CallLogService is not part of the Rainbow core service and is available via the CallLogPlugin. The first thing to do is to add this plugin to our project. Add the CallLogPlugin in our project import { CallLogPlugin } from 'rainbow-web-sdk/lib'; ... this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ host: { server, apiClientKey, appModuleKey }, plugins: [ CallLogPlugin ], autoLogin: true }) The CallLogService is the entry point for all call logs manipulations. import { CallLogService } from 'rainbow-web-sdk'; ... constructor() { this.sdk = RainbowSDK.getInstance(); // get the UsersListsService service this.callLogService: CallLogService = this.sdk.CallLogService; } CallLogService API To manage the call logs, we will use the CallLogService which offers one of several APIs that can be classified as follows: APIs for retrieving call logs initCallLogs isInitialized getCallLogs getNextCallLogs APIs for data counters getCallLogsCounter getMissedCallsCounter APIs for deleting call logs deleteCallLogsForUser deleteCallLog deleteAllCallLogs APIS for marking call logs markCallLogAsRead markAllCallsLogsAsRead CallLogService also emits events when the data counters (total number of available call logs, number of missed calls) and when the current call logs history have been updated.

    "content": "DocumentationConversationsLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22Conversations At the heart of Rainbow : the conversations The notion of conversation is central to the Rainbow environment. Almost everything revolves around 'conversations'. But what is really a conversation for Rainbow ? Here is a tentative of definition : 🧭 DEFINITION A conversation modelize an interaction between one or more Rainbow users. By interaction, we mean chat, audio or video and much more. In the Rainbow ecosystem we'll come across two types of conversations: The \"peer-to-peer\" (P2P) conversations : where two Rainbow users interact with each other. The \"bubble\" conversations : where several users interact all together (see the BubblesPlugin for more information about bubbles). A conversation can be considered as a virtual meeting room. But a virtual room with ears👂, eyes 👀, and memory 🧠 . The conversation entity is responsible for managing the history of your exchanges: text or voice messages, documents, recordings of audio or video conversations. ConversationService API Now let's look at how to create and to access to the existing conversations. To manage the conversations, we will use the ConversationService service that offers the following APIs: subscribe getConversations getConversation removeConversation setConversationBookmark Subscribe to conversationService events To be informed of the creation or deletion of a conversation with a user or a bubble, you need to subscribe to ConversationServiceEvents. Handle these events is necessary to be notified that another user has created a conversation with us, but also to manage the multi-client issue. this.conversationService.subscribe((event: RBEvent<ConversationServiceEvents>) => { const conversation: Conversation = event.data.conversation; switch (event.name) { case ConversationServiceEvents.ON_SERVICE_STARTED: ... break; case ConversationServiceEvents.ON_CONVERSATION_CREATED: ... break; case ConversationServiceEvents.ON_CONVERSATION_REMOVED: ... break; case ConversationServiceEvents.ON_MESSAGE_ADDED_IN_CONVERSATION: ... break; case ConversationServiceEvents.ON_MESSAGE_MODIFIED_IN_CONVERSATION: ... break; default: break; } }) Get all conversations It is sometimes necessary to know all my current conversions. This time we're going to use ConversationService getConversations method: const conversations = this.conversationService.getConversations(); Get or create a P2P conversation Create or getting an existing conversation is really simple with the Rainbow SDK, and requires a single conversationService method: getConversation. This method will create the conversation if it not already exists, else it'll return the existing conversation. This is an async method cause it can invoke server remote methods (conversation creation or fetch existing conversation). As Rainbow environnement is multiClient a modification on conversation on a client will be automatically reported to conversation on other client (ressource). // Fetch the user const user = ...; // Get the conversation associate to the user const conversation = await this.conversationService.getConversation(user); Get or create a Bubble conversation Get a bubble conversation is just as easy : // Fetch Bubble const bubble = ...; // Get the conversation associate to the bubble const conversation = await this.conversationService.getConversation(bubble); Remove a conversation Removing a conversation is just as simple, we will use the conversationService removeConversation method. // Remove a conversation await this.conversationService?.removeConversation(conversation); Conversation API Preamble The most common action (and also the simplest) in a conversation is exchanging text messages or documents. In the rest of this article, we'll look at how to use the Rainbow SDK to implement this functionality. We will then look at how to send, modify and delete messages. We'll also look at the different types of message and sending methods. 💡 NOTE The following methods are working both for peer2peer or bubble conversations.In the following example we're going to use a peerToPeer conversation, but the use is identical with a bubble conversation. Here are the main Conversation methods: getHistoryPage getMessages sendMessage modifyMessage deleteMessage deleteAllMessages forwardMessage Load messages history pages and reach the messages array A rainbow conversation, whether P2P or bubble, is an exchange of text messages between two or more people. Of course, Rainbow will manage the history of these messages, i.e. it's possible to retrieve messages already exchanged. The getHistoryPage method lets us load the history of our messages in paginated form. Simply call it and specify the number of messages you wish to retrieve. Then the getMessages methods allows us to handle message as an array. /// Fetch the user \"A\" const user = ... // Get the conversation associate to the user \"A\" const conversation = await this.conversationService.getConversat"

    "content": "DocumentationData channelsLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22DataChannel Plugin The WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is primarily known for its support for audio and video communications, however, it also offers peer-to-peer data channels. This article explains more about this, how to use it via the Rainbow SDK and how this peer-to-peer commmunication mechanism can also be used in rainbow conferences for broadcasting arbitrary content to conference participants But first, what is a data channel? A WebRTC data channel lets you send text or binary data over an active connection to a peer. Rainbow uses reliable channels which guarantee that messages you send arrive at the other peer and in the same order in which they're sent. This is analogous to a web socket. DataChannel in Rainbow! Rainbow platform offers DataChannel capabilities for peer-to-peer conversations but also for bubble conversations. ⚠️ WARNING It should be noted, however, that the services offered will differ in both cases. Peer-to-peer conversation dataChannels Some explanation The main idea is to establish a bidirectional data exchange pipe between two Rainbow users. Rainbow is a \"multi-device\" communication system, meaning that a user can be connected simultaneously to several devices (resources). But a dataChannel offers a peer-to-peer connection, which means you'll need to identify which user's resource you're going to connect to. But don't worry, the Rainbow SDK takes care of this part of the job: When a Rainbow user \"A\" creates a dataChannel to another Rainbow user \"B\", an invitation to join the dataChannel is sent to all the devices (resources) of \"B\". User \"B\" can then accept (or refuse) the invitation to join the dataChannel on the device of his choice. The peer-to-peer connection will then be established between \"A\"'s device having created the DataChannel and the device chosen by \"B\". Once established, \"A\" and \"B\" can exchange data bidirectionally. This connection can be interrupted by any protagonist. Both users will be informed of the end of the connection by an event. How to start dataChannel with Rainbow SDK? Add the dataChannel Plugin in your project import { DataChannelPlugin } from 'rainbow-web-sdk/lib'; ... this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ host: { server, apiClientKey, appModuleKey }, plugins: [ ConversationPlugin, ..., DataChannelPlugin ], autoLogin: true }) Import the dataChannelService in your code import { DataChannelService, DataChannelStatus, DataChannelServiceEvent, DATA_CHANNEL_SVC } from 'rainbow-web-sdk'; ... constructor() { this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.getInstance(); this.dataChannelService = this.rainbowSDK.get<DataChannelService>(DATA_CHANNEL_SVC); } Consider the dataChannel creator side User \"A\" will create a dataChannel with user \"B\" // Fetch user \"B\" contact const contact = ... // Create the dataChannel const dataChannel = await this.dataChannelService?.createDataChannel(contact, 'DataChannel Description'); The status of this new dataChannel is \"proposed\" dataChannel.status = 'proposed. The invitation is sent to \"userB\" (see later how B receives this invitation), to be inform of the dataChannel status change (ie: when user \"B\" accept or refuse this invitation) just add a listener on this dataChannel status: // Listen dataChannel status events dataChannel?.onStatusChanged((status: DataChannelStatus) => { if (status === 'connected') { // Attach a listener on dataChannel messages events dataChannel?.onMessageReceived((data: any) => { // Enjoy your dataChannel messages }); } if (status === 'refused') { // Handle your deception // For example you can call your psy or start to drink !! } } Consider the dataChannel receiver side Now change your point of view and have a look on receiver side. To be informed of an eventual dataChannel invitation, user \"B\" have to listen event from dataChannelService. Also listen // Listen dataChannelService events (to receive the dataChannel object) this.dataChannelService?.subscribe((event: RBEvent) => { if (event.name === DataChannelServiceEvents.RAINBOW_ON_DATACHANNEL_AVAILABLE) { dataChannel: DataChannel = event.data; // Listen dataChannel status events dataChannel?.onStatusChanged((status: DataChannelStatus) => { if (status === 'connected') { // Attach a listener on dataChannel messages events dataChannel?.onMessageReceived((data: any) => { // Enjoy your dataChannel messages }); } } } The status of the received dataChannel is \"invited\":dataChannel.status = 'invited'. The user \"B\" can either accept or refuse this dataChannel invitation. await this.dataChannelService?.acceptDataChannel(dataChannel); or await this.dataChannelService?.refuseDataChannel(dataChannel); We now suppose that user \"B\" has accepted the dataChannel invitation, both user are informed that the connection is established by a change status event. It is now time to exchange data ! await this.dataChannelService?.sendMessage(\"Some data\"); The other user will received the data via the onMessageReceived e"

Favorites are Rainbow items that you specifically mark so that it's more convenient to use them afterwards, a bit like bookmarks in a browser. Only certain types of Rainbow items can be tagged as favorites: Rainbow users Rainbow bubbles Rainbow Business contacts Rainbow Personal contacts Microsoft Azure AD users/Microsoft O365 contacts 💡 Note PBX Users contacts cannot be marked as favorite. Favorites allows you to set up quickly a conversation with a Rainbow user or bubble. And for all items, a quick access to their detailed information card (Profile, phone numbers, location, etc.). Please note that the FavoritesService is not part of the Rainbow core service and is available via the FavoritesPlugin. The first thing to do is to add this plugin to our project. Add the FavoritesPlugin in our project import { FavoritesPlugin } from 'rainbow-web-sdk/lib'; ... this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ host: { server, apiClientKey, appModuleKey }, plugins: [ FavoritesPlugin ], autoLogin: true }) The FavoritesService is the entry point for all favorites manipulations. import { FavoritesService } from 'rainbow-web-sdk'; ... constructor() { this.sdk = RainbowSDK.getInstance(); // get the FavoritesService service this.favoritesService: FavoritesService = this.sdk.FavoritesService; } FavoritesService API To manage the favorites, we will use the FavoritesService that offers the following APIs: subscribe getFavorites addToFavorites deleteFavorite deleteFromFavorites moveFavoritePosition FavoritesService also emits events on each operation it deems relevant, in our case each time an add/delete/move operation is successfully completed. Listening FavoritesService events To be informed of FavoritesService modification you can subscribe to FavoritesService events: const favoritesServiceSubscription = this.favoritesService?.subscribe((event: RBEvent) => { switch(event.name) { case FavoritesServiceEvents.ON_FAVORITE_CREATED: const newFavorite Favorite = event.data.favorite; ... break; case FavoritesServiceEvents.ON_FAVORITE_DELETED: ... break; case FavoritesServiceEvents.ON_FAVORITES_ORDER_CHANGED: ... break; default: break; } }); Get all your favorites The getFavorites method returns all the Rainbow items you've marked as favorites. // Get all my favorites const myFavorites: Favorite[] = this.favoritesService?.getFavorites(); Favorites are returned as an ordered table. 💡 Important note The index in the array corresponds to the position of the favorite in the list, starting from 0. Add an Rainbow item as a favorite The addToFavorites method allows to add a Rainbow item specified by its object instance to your favorites list. 💡 Note According to the Rainbow items managed, this object instance must be either of User or Bubble type. // The user to mark as favorite const userToAdd: User = ...; // Add this user to favorites list await this.favoritesService?.addToFavorites(userToAdd); A favorite is always added to the end of the favorites list. A ON_FAVORITE_CREATED event is sent afterwards at the completion of the operation to notify about the favorite creation. The new created favorite is also provided through this event. 💡 Tips It is also possible to search users to add in your favorites list by using the directorySearchService. // Search for the user \"Alicia Stones\" to add it in the favorites list // We'll assume that the search will return just one result const searchResults: DirectorySearchResults= await this.sdk.directorySearchService?.searchByName(\"Alicia Stones\", DirectoryType.RAINBOW_USERS); const userFound: User = searchResults.users[0]; await this.favoritesService?.addToFavorites(userFound); Delete a favorite by its identifier The deleteFavorite method allows to delete a favorite specified by its identifier. // The favorite to delete const favoriteA: Favorite = ...; // Delete a favorite by its identifier await this.favoritesService?.deleteFavorite(favoriteA.id); A ON_FAVORITE_DELETED event is sent afterwards at the completion of the operation to notify about the favorite deletion.

    "content": "DocumentationPluginsLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22Rainbow SDK: Plugins The Rainbow platform offers a wide variety of services, from simple text chat to webinar services and file storage. Obviously, you won't be using all of Rainbow's services in your application. You may only need to manage webRTC communications, in which case it would be a shame to have to embed the entire Rainbow library in your project if you only use a small part of it. With the Rainbow SDK V1, you had no choice, it was all or nothing, and that was really problematic. So we chose to break our new SDK down into smaller functional parts called 'plugins'. In the previous examples we learned how to start a minimal Rainbow project, able to connect to a server, manage contacts but nothing more. To use some of Rainbown's more interesting features, you'll need to specify which plugins you want to use. Remember that part of our code that created the Rainbow SDK object: this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ appConfig: { server: 'demo.openrainbow.org' }, plugins: [], autoLogin: true }); We're now going to take a closer look at the plugins table, which we've left empty for the moment. Here is the list of currently available plugins Bubbles plugin Polls plugin Favorites plugin DataChannels plugin Admin plugin To use a plugin in Rainbow, simply add it to the plugins table. In the folowing example, we will add two plugins ConversationPlugin and DataChannelPlugin : import { ConversationPlugin, TelephonyPlugin } from 'rainbow-web-sdk'; this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ host: { server: 'demo.openrainbow.org' }, plugins: [ TelephonyPlugin, DataChannelPlugin ], autoLogin: true }) 💡 NOTE Even if some plugins are dependent on each other (for example the dataChannelPlugin requires the conversationPlugin). Each plugin can be declared on its own in Rainbow's configuration. Missing plugins will be automatically added. So no need to worry about that 😄 Please consult the plugin documentation pages to understand their specific roles. We have decided to break down the alphabetical classification and present them in order of increasing importance.

In a very original way, we're going to call this connected user the connectedUser Once connected, this user can be accessed at any time via the RainbowSDK singleton. As already say, the RainbowSDK object is a singleton object which can be accessed at any time and everywhere in your application via it's static getInstance method. The connectedUser is an instance of ConnectedUser class which inherits of User class, so our connectedUser is a regular user but with some facilities. How to fetch this connected user It's really easy : // Get the Rainbow SDK singleton instance const sdk: RainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.getInstance(); // Now get the connected user const connectedUser: ConnectedUser = sdk.connectedUser; ConnectedUser methods As already said, the connected User is a regular Rainbow User with extended facilities. It represents the user of the application, so it will offer actions for modifying information about the user:. Here is the list of available apis : setPresenceStatus getAvailablePresenceStatusList updateProfile updateCustomData setCustomAvatar removeCustomAvatar updatePassword deleteAccount In the following parts of this document we will describe quickly the usage of these methods. But, for more information please have a look on the API documentation. Set the connected user presence status The \"setPresenceStatus\" method permits to set the connected user presence status. This is the presence status which is shared with the other Rainbow users. Available values are : UserPresenceStatus.ONLINE : user goes to online (or can 'exit') any manual state; In case of a call in progress, the user will go to busy state; UserPresenceStatus.AWAY : a manual Away state UserPresenceStatus.XA : 'invisble' or 'appear offline' manual state UserPresenceStatus.DND : Do not disturb manual state Available status are given by the getAvailablePresenceStatusList method. // Set the connectedUser presence status to AWAY await sdk.connectedUser.setPresenceStatus(UserPresenceStatus.AWAY); Get the available presence status list for the connected user The \"getAvailablePresenceStatusList\" method returns a list of status that the user can currently set. Depending of the user state at a given time, all values are not available (for example when the user is busy on phone, it is not possible to change it's status presence) // Get the current available presence status list const statuses: string[] = await sdk.connectedUser.getAvailablePresenceStatusList(); Update userConnected profile data The \"updateProfile\" method allows to update the user's profile data (name, emails, numbers, etc). Updatable user data are described in the \"UserProfile\" interface. // First create the UserProfile object const userProfile: UserProfile = { title: 'myTitle' }; // Update user profile await this.sdk.connectedUser?.updateProfile(userProfile); Update userConnected custom data The \"updateCustomData\" method allows to update the user's custom data. TODO: MCO WTF ??? const userCustomData = { ??? }; await this.sdk.connectedUser?.updateCustomData(userCustomData); Set custom avatar to connected user Users have a default avatar generated from the initials of their first and/or last names. Ex: User John Do, will have the default avatar : JD. But this avatar can be overloaded by an image chosen by the user. The \"setCustomAvatar\" method permits to overload the avatar // Convert image from url to base64 const base64Avatar = await this.sdk.utils.getBase64Image('assets/images/zerock.jpg'); // Set base64 avatar await this.sdk.connectedUser?.setCustomAvatar(base64Avatar); Remove custom avatar of the connected user The \"removeCustomAvatar\" Restore default avatar of the connected user // Remove custom connected user avatar await this.sdk.connectedUser?.removeCustomAvatar(); Change connected user password The \"updatePassword\" methods alow to change the current user password. Depending on user sign-in configuration method, this method may not work. // Update the connectedUser password await this.sdk.connectedUser?.updatePassword('oldPassword', 'newPassword', true); Delete the connected user account The \"deleteAccount\" method deletes the connectedUser account and all its associated data.

Additionally, you can create privileged relations with them that let you access to information such as their availability. Doing so let you build a lot of scenarios and could help you knowing the best way to reach them. The Rainbow SDK for Web offers a lot of methods that will be covered in that guide to let you build and manage your relationships. Rainbow Knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide. Rainbow conceptsDetails The connected userThis is the logged user, in other words : you.The connected user have a set of specific methods which allow to change avatar, profile info, etc... The user networkThis is the list of users with whom the connected user shares his availability, such as his presence on the phone, his activity, etc.. The network is empty by default and can grow by sending and accepting invitations to Rainbow users. This action is call joining the network. A network userA network user is a Rainbow user who is in the network of the connected user. An network invitationAn invitation to join the network is a request that can be sent to any Rainbow users who can be found by the search engine. An invitation can be accepted or declined.When accepted, the user is added to the network or other user and inversely. When declined, the request is discarded. The user listsUsers in Rainbow can be gathered by defining lists. Lists allow to categorize and organize your relations, friends, colleagues, bots, connected things, etc. Preamble As indicated in the introduction, using Rainbow, you can interact with users, bots or things. Having an interaction means: Being able to discover any entities such a users, bots or things Being able to dialog actively with them for example by making a video call with an user or receiving an instant message from a bot Being able to keep a link to them (e.g. retrieving the conversation or creating groups) And being able to get passive information from them such as their connection presence, phone presence, etc... Which means having a privileged relation. The different kinds of interactions are described in the following paragraphs.

    "content": "DocumentationUsers discoveryLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22Discovering Rainbow users A short introduction The first thing to do to interact with users is to be able to find them! This step can be done with the integrated search engine. The SDK for Web now offers an centralized method to let you find Rainbow users. We're going to use the directorySearchService to do this. To cut a long story short, the directorySearch service allows you to search in the connectedUser network and the various directories accessible by Rainbow in a consistent way. In the previous step, we created test users. Now it's time to look at how to interact find them. The directorySearchService will enable us to easily search for a Rainbow user. // Search for the users who are matching with the \"Bob\" search criteria // in the Rainbow directory const searchEngine = this.sdk.directorySearchService; const result: DirectorySearchResults = await searchEngine?.searchByName(\"Bob\", DirectoryType.RAINBOW_USERS); // The directorySearch engine returns a DirectorySearchResults objevt. // It contains an array of User instance which match the criteria // Note that this array can be empty if no matching entity is found. // In our case we have already created a \"Bob\" user in a previous stage, // so, this array should not be empty... const users: Users[] = results.users; At this point of the reading, you are able to find your test users and you can skip the read of this chapter to continue your Rainbow SDK exploration. Skip and continue to User's network But you'll find in the following part an exhaustive documentation on Rainbow directories and about the directorySearch engine usage. Rainbow Directories Rainbow manages various directories in which users and contacts can be searched: 1. The \"User's Network\" This directory type is more of a container than a directory an refers to the network of Rainbow users of the logged-in user. This network contains users who have been explicitly invited by the logged-in user to share their online status. 🔒 Availability : No profile feature is required to use this directory. Any Rainbow user, including those belonging to the default company, can use this directory. 2. The \"Rainbow Users directory\" The Rainbow Users directory is composed of all Rainbow users belonging to the 'Rainbow' default company as well as all End Company users created by a company administrator. The directory scope corresponds to all Rainbow public users and users being in companies visible to the logged-in user (this visibility depends on that defined for the logged-in user and the company he belongs to). Advanced points on limited visibility: If logged-in user has the visibility defined as 'closed' or 'isolated' OR the same as the same the company to which he belongs to and this company has visibility 'closed' or 'isolated', then the directory scope includes only users being in companies visible by the logged-in user's company. If logged-in user has the visibility defined as 'hotspot' OR the same as the company to which he belongs and this company has visibility 'hotspot', then no user is visible. 🔒 Availability : No profile feature is required to use this directory. Any Rainbow user, including those belonging to the default company, can use this directory. 3. The \"Rainbow Business Contact Directory\" The business directory is global to an End Company and contains a list of contacts (people and/or companies) shared by company members, i.e. Rainbow users. There are 2 types of business contacts: user and company. A business contact is of type user if a first or last name has been defined for it. A business contact is of type company if only a company name has been defined for it, but no first or last name. The type of business contacts will influence their search process, as we'll see later. Company members can search contacts, display information on a specific contact, and invite it to join their network. The business directory can be configured either by a \"company administrator\", or a \"company member\" with the \"business directory\" role. A user can only search company directory contacts belonging to his company. \"company_admin\" and \"directory_admin\" users can only search company directory contacts belonging to his company. \"bp_admin\" user can only search company directory contacts belonging to his own company or to his end customer companies. 🔒 Availability : No profile feature is required to use this directory. A user of a default company cannot use this directory. 4. The \"Rainbow Personal Contact Directory\" The personal directory is similar to the business directory, but is global to a Rainbow user and available on all Rainbow clients (web/desktop, iOS, Android).\\ There are 2 types of personal contacts: user and company. A personal contact is of type user if a first or last name has been defined for it. A personal contact is of type company if only a company name has been defined for it, but no first or last name.

A Rainbow user can be a member of several lists. 💡 Important note Only Rainbow users can be added in a user's list. Other Rainbow items such as the Rainbow bubbles, the Rainbow Business contacts, and the Rainbow Personal contacts cannot. A name must be associated with a user's list, and this name must be unique. It is also possible but optional to give to a user's list a description (to indicate what the list is about) and to mark it as favorite. These information about the list itself are called the \"list profile\". A user's list can only be managed and used by you, and cannot be shared. This tutorial will explain how to create a new user's list, add, and remove users in this list and update the list profile. Please note that the UsersListsService is not part of the Rainbow core service and is available via the UsersListsPlugin. The first thing to do is to add this plugin to our project. Add the UsersListsPlugin in our project import { UsersListsPlugin } from 'rainbow-web-sdk/lib'; ... this.rainbowSDK = RainbowSDK.create({ host: { server, apiClientKey, appModuleKey }, plugins: [ UsersListsPlugin ], autoLogin: true }) The UsersListsService is the entry point for all user's lists manipulations. import { UsersListsService } from 'rainbow-web-sdk'; ... constructor() { this.sdk = RainbowSDK.getInstance(); // get the UsersListsService this.usersListsService: UsersListsService = this.sdk.UsersListsService; } UsersListsService API To manage the user's lists, we will use the UsersListsService that offers the following APIs: subscribe getUsersLists getUsersListById createUsersList deleteUsersList UsersListsService also emits events on each operation it deems relevant, in our case each time an add/delete/move operation is successfully completed. Listening UsersListsService events To be informed of UsersListsService modification you can subscribe to UsersListsService events: const usersListsServiceSubscription = this.usersListsService?.subscribe((event: RBEvent) => { switch (event.name) { case UsersListsServiceEvents.ON_USERS_LIST_CREATED: // event.data contains a UsersList object console.info(`New user's list: id: ${(event.data.id)} - name: ${(event.data.name)}`); break; case UsersListsServiceEvents.ON_USERS_LIST_PROFILE_UPDATED: // event.data contains a UsersList object console.info(`Updated user's list: id: ${(event.data.id)} - name: ${(event.data.name)}`); break; case UsersListsServiceEvents.ON_USERS_LIST_DELETED: // event.data contains just the id of the deleted list console.info(`Deleted user's list: id: ${(event.data)}`); break; case UsersListsServiceEvents.ON_USER_ADDED_TO_LIST: // event.data contains a UsersList object (updated list) and a User object (added user) console.info(`User added in list ${(event.data.list.name)}: user name: ${(event.data.user.name)}`); break; case UsersListsServiceEvents.ON_USER_REMOVED_FROM_LIST: // event.data contains a UsersList object (updated list) and a User Id (removed user) console.info(`User removed from list ${(event.data.list.name)}: user id: ${(event.data.userId)}`); break; default: break; } }); Get all user's lists The getUsersLists method returns all the user's lists you've defined with their properties. // Get all my user's lists const myUsersLists: UsersList[] = this.usersListsService?.getUsersLists(); Users lists are returned as an unordered table. Get a user's list by id The getUsersListById method returns one user's list specified by its id with their properties. // Get one user's lists data const listId: string = ...; const listA: UsersList = this.usersListsService?.getUsersListById(listId); Create a user's list The createUsersList method allows to create a user's list. Only the name of the user's list is mandatory for creation. The other information (description and favorite status) are optional and can be set afterwards using the updateProfile API . // Create a new list of people in the marketing department const newList: UsersListProfile = { name: \"Marketing\", description: \"a few details about this list...\", isFavorite: false }; await this.usersListsService?.createUsersList(newList); A ON_USERS_LIST_CREATED event is sent afterwards at the completion of the operation to notify about the user's list creation. The new created user's list is also provided through this event. At this step, a unique identifier has been assigned to the user's list, but it contains no members. Delete a user's list The deleteUsersList method allows to de"

    "content": "DocumentationUsers networkLTS release 5.0.0Published on 2024-06-22The user's Network The user's network is the set of users, bots and connected things that have a privileged relation with you (the connected user). By privileged relation, you have to understand that these contacts have access to your personal information as well as your availability such as your connection presence and activity and your phone presence. That is why when someone or something wants to have a privileged relation with you, it sends you an invitation that you need to accept let it enter your network. This action is mutual. When you join the network of someone, this person or entity enters your network. Keep this in mind! The only shortcut is that when both entities are in the same company, an auto-acceptation is done. So the invite is automatically accepted and you have nothing to do on your side. Each entity of your network can be removed at any time. 💡 NOTE In case of being removed from one's network by a user who is part of your network, you will still see him as a member of your network but without having access to his availability status. To manage the connected user network we will use a the UserNetworkService. Here is the list of available apis : getUsers removeUser sendInvitation sendInvitationByEmail sendBulkInvitations getSentInvitations getReceivedInvitations acceptInvitation declineInvitation subscribe How to get this userNetwork service : // get the userNetwork service const userNetwork: UserNetworkservice = this.sdk.userNetwork; Get all the userNetwork users The \"getUsers\" method returns all the users conatined in the userConected network. // Get all the userNetwork service const networkUsers: User[] = this.sdk.userNetwork.getUsers(); 💡 NOTE It is also possible to search users in the userNetwork by using the directorySearchService. Remove a user from your network The \"removeUser\" methods permits to remove a user from your network. As already explain, the \"removed\" user will not be informed that you have removed it from your network. From his point of view, you are still present in his network, only he will no longer be able to consult all your information (presence, etc...). // The user to remove const userToRemove: User = ...; // remove the user from my network await this.sdk.userNetwork.removeUser(userToRemove); Invite a user to join your network The \"sendInvitation\" method is used to invite a Rainbow user to join our network. In the case of same company, the invitation will be auto-accepted by the distant. In case of different companies, this will send an invitation and email to the distant user. You can also specified a custom message in the invitation. // The user to invite const userToInvite: User = ...; // A impartial custom message const customMessage: string = 'Hello Rainbow is top, join us!!!'; // Send the invitation await this.sdk.userNetwork.sendInvitation(userToInvite, customMessage); You can also invite a user by it's email (Whether he's already a rainbow user or not. If the email address does not correspond to a Rainbow user, the person will receive an email inviting them to create an account). // Send invitation by Email await this.sdk.userNetwork.sendInvitationByEmail('gold@orak.com', 'Message from vega'); And finally, you can invite a group of people to join your network by providing a list of e-mail addresses. // Send invitation by Email await this.sdk.userNetwork.sendBulkInvitations(['captain@flam.com', 'al@bator.com'); A list of sent invitations can be retrieved by using the method getSentInvitations. // Get the sent invitation list const sentInvitations: NetworkInvitation[] = this.sdk.userNetwork.getSentInvitations(); Answering to network's requests Two possibilities are available to be aware of invitations received from others users or entities: Either you can retrieve the list of invitations received by calling the method getReceivedInvitation. // Get the received invitation list const recvInvitations: NetworkInvitation[] = this.sdk.userNetwork.getReceivedInvitation(); Or you can listen subscribe to UserNetworkService events to know in real time when someone wants to enter your network. this.sdk.userNetwork.subscribe((event: RBEvent<UserNetworkServiceEvents>) => { switch (event.name) { case UserNetworkServiceEvents.RAINBOW_ON_INVITATIONS_LIST_UPDATED: ... break; case UserNetworkServiceEvents.RAINBOW_ON_INVITATION_RECEIVED: ... break; case UserNetworkServiceEvents.RAINBOW_ON_INVITATION_ACCEPTED: ... break; } }); In both cases, you get an NetworkInvitation object that you can accept or decline using acceptInvitation or declineInvitation methods. // The received invitation const recvInvitation: NetworkInvitation = ...; // Accept the invitation this.sdk.userNetwork.acceptInvitation(recvInvitation); // Or decline the invitation this.sdk.userNetwork.declineInvitation(recvInvitation); Go to User's list On this page Get all the userNetwork users Remove a user from your network Invite a user to join "

    "content": "DocumentationConnect to RainbowConnecting to Rainbow Preamble The Rainbow platform offers REST APIs to make it easier doing administrative and provisionning tasks such as creating new Rainbow users, etc... For being able to make these requests, you need first to authenticate your user to Rainbow in order to received a token that will let you invoke other APIs. This tutorial explains how to authenticate to Rainbow and how to call API using the token received. Additional information can be found in the Authentication API documentation. Users authentication Authentication API Users authentication to Rainbow is done by calling the API api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/login. This API will try to authenticate you and in case of sucess will return a token that is mandatory for calling other Rainbow APIs. Depending where you want to connect, you have to use the following hosts: For connecting to the Rainbow Sandbow platform for developers, you have to use the host sandbox.openrainbow.com For connecting to the Rainbow Production platform, you have to use the host openrainbow.com For both platforms, you need to have a valid and deployed application id with the associated secret key. Authentication information To authenticate, you need to have: A login email: This can be a Rainbow official account, a sandbox developer account or a any other test accounts A password: The Rainbow password associated to the account used An application Id: The id of a deployed application on the platform you want to connect A secret key: The secret key associated to the application used This diagram sums-up this authentication procedure. In return, you will receive: Information about the user connected Information about the application used A valid token Authentication code sample Here is a example of code for authenticating to Rainbow: This sample will load some JavaScript dependencies to ease your development: <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/4.5.9/es5-shim.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es6-promise/4.0.5/es6-promise.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.9-1/crypto-js.min.js\"></script> Put the previous lines in your HTML file. Once done, you can edit your JavaScript file and add the following lines: // Your Rainbow login email var loginEmail = \"jon.doe@mycompany.com\"; // Your Rainbow password var password = \"MyPassword_12!\"; // Rainbow developers sandbox platform var host = \"sandbox.openrainbow.com\"; // Protocol to use var protocol = \"https://\"; // Port var port = \"443\"; // Your application Id - replace by your own application ID var appID = \"7b18d330e3f41...a9fb4194558de16c\"; // The secret key associated to the application - replace by you own secret key var appSecretKey = \"dWgSBzCf6aoXOULVudU8z...EL82OScnczQ2BrWXtdqVeEH9Yat6F4xOsl8z\"; // The token received var token = \"\"; var authenticate = function authenticate(email, password, id, secret) { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { var auth = btoa(email + \":\" + password); var appAuth = btoa(id + \":\" + CryptoJS.SHA256(secret + password)); var authenticateURL = \"/api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/login\"; $.ajax({ url: protocol + host + \":\" + port + authenticateURL, method: \"GET\", headers: { Accept: \"application/json\", Authorization: \"Basic \" + auth, \"x-rainbow-app-auth\": \"Basic \" + appAuth } }) .done(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) { resolve(data); }) .fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) { reject(errorThrown); }); }); }; authenticate(loginEmail, password, appID, appSecretKey) .then(function(json) { token = json.token; }) .catch(function(err) { //... }); When the authentication has succedded, you receive a JSON object containing the following structure: { \"loggedInApplication\": { // Properties of the application }, \"loggedInUser\": { // Properties of the user }, // Valid token received \"token\": \"eyJ0e..._pwB34-JJ6EF8x0hsg\" } Note: The token received has to be used for all other requests to Rainbow. Using Rainbow Tokens Once authenticated, each Rainbow request must contain this Rainbow token to be valid. This paragraph describes what are Rainbow tokens and how to renew them. Understanding Rainbow tokens Rainbow tokens are JSON Web tokens. A Rainbow token contains: The exp (expiration time): After this date/time, Rainbow will no more accept request containing this token. The iat (issued at): The time when the token was issued. The countRenewed: The number of time this token has been renewed. The maxTokenRenew: The maximum time the token can be renewed. Rainbow token received expires after 21600 minutes (ie: after 15 days). You can extract information to now the expiration time. Check token validity Rainbow offers an API to check if a token is still valid or not. You have to call the API /api/rainbow/authentication/v1.0/validator like in the following sample: var checkToken = function checkToken(token) { return new Promis"

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedGetting Started Preamble Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow REST APIs! The Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (ALE) Rainbow REST APIs are a set of APIs based on HTTP methods which makes it easy for developers to write applications that connect to Rainbow using any programming langage. This tutorial will help you starting with the ALE Rainbow REST APIs by explaining what you can do and how to use them. Prerequisites There is no real prerequisites on using REST API: You can call REST APIs from any desktop OS like Windows, MacOS and Linux... and from any mobile OS like iOS and Android... When developing native applications, You can call REST APIs from any kind of programming languages like JavaScript, Java, Swift, C#, Curl, PHP... When developing Web applications, you can call REST APIs from any kind of browsers like Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox... Why offering REST APIs ? The Rainbow platform offers REST APIs to make it easier doing administrative tasks and provisionning. These APIs are here to help companies that want to integrate with Rainbow. For these tasks, integrating a SDK can be more complicated that calling some API directly. So, Rainbow REST APIs allow companies, integrators, IT, Business Partners or administrators to connect their back-end servers to Rainbow (B2B integration) for automating tasks like provisionning accounts, assigning a PBX system to a site, a phone number to a user... For all other types of integration with Rainbow (ie: end-customer applications), we recommand using a SDK (eg: SDK for Web, Node.JS, iOS or Android). REST APIs overview REST APIs cover several aspects of the administration and are grouped by theme. Here is the list of themes that can be used: ThemeDescriptions Applications APIsThese APIs authenticate your application and manage the application token Companies APIsThese APIs are dedicated to manage End Customers companies Sites APIsThese APIs allow to create and manage sites Organizations APIsThese APIs are used to create and manage organizations Systems APIsThese APIs allos to create and manage a PABX systems Users APIsThese APIs are dedicated to create and manage users in End Customers companies Users Profiles APIsThese APIs are used to get the profiles associated to users Authentication APIsThese APIs authenticate the user and manage the token Voice Provisioning APIsThese APIs are used to provision Rainbow Voice Communication Platform Mass Provisioning APIThis API is used to import users or devices Metrics APIsUse these APIs to get metrics for your application Invoices APIsUse these APIs to retrieve invoices Offers APIsThese APIs list the Rainbow offers Quotations APIsThese APIs are dedicated to create quotations Subscriptions APIsThese APIs are used to create and manage subscriptions Note: Depending the role and right of the user, access to these APIs can be denied (see next paragraph). REST APIs level Rights Rainbow defines different roles and rights for a user. Depending on these roles and rights the connecter user has, API are available or not. This table describes the existing roles and rights. RoleRightDescription user-This is the default role of users in Rainbow. Each time a user creates an account for using Rainbow, he has the user role.Note: Users with user role are limited to the REST Authentication API. adminsite_adminA user with site_admin right is limited to manage a site of an End Customer company. Note: Users with site_admin right are limited to the REST Systems API and Sites API (for doing modifications). admincompany_adminA user with company_admin right is limited to manage an End Customer company. Note: Users with company_admin have access to all REST API except the REST Quotations API. adminorganization_adminA user with organization_admin right can manage all companies under an organization. Note: Users with organization_admin have access to all REST API except the REST Quotations API. An extra right bp_admin can be added that allows to subscribe a company to an offer using the REST Subscriptions API and to have access to the REST Quotations API. How to access to REST APIs ? REST APIs are available on both developers and official Rainbow platforms: On the Rainbow Developers Sandboxed Platform: To access REST APIs on that platform, you have to prefix the requests by the domain https://sandbox.openrainbow.com. On the Rainbow Official Platform: To access REST APIs on that platform, you have to prefix the requests by the domain https://openrainbow.com. Depending the platform used, restrictions can occur like describing in the next paragraphes. Using REST APIs on the Developers Sandboxed Platform REST APIs can be used on the Developers Sandboxed Platform with the following restrictions: Subscriptions API are not available Offers API are not available Quotations API are not available Invoices API are not available All others API can be used. Depending on the right of the user who sends"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging conferencesLTS release 2.61.0Published on 202-04-06Conference Preamble This guide describes how to use SFU which is Rainbow conference service. This conference uses bubbles. Minimal permissions Before starting with web RTC, you have to add differents permissions in your manifest file. <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\"/> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\"/> You also have to add theses lines of code at the starting of your application to manage permissions programmatically. Indeed, since android 5, you can modify permissions directly in applications menu. So, permissions can be not authorized. Example with RECORD_AUDIO permission Here is an example for requesting the permission to request the microphone if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(getActivity(), Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) { ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(getActivity(), new String[]{Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO}, REQUEST_MICROPHONE); } where REQUEST_MICROPHONE is a int defined by the developer. A dialog window will open and the user of the application can be choose if he wants to authorize permissions. After, you should put theses lines of code. Theses lines allows to you to know the choice of the user. @Override public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String permissions[], @NonNull int[] grantResults) { switch (requestCode) { case REQUEST_MICROPHONE: { // If request is cancelled, the result arrays are empty. if (grantResults.length > 0) {// for example, open your call activity... } else { // permission denied, boo! Disable the //functionality that depends on this permission //or exit application if it is mandatory to have theses permissions. } break; } } } Start a conference To start a conference, the user must be the owner of the bubble. If it is the case, you should yse this method: RainbowSdk.instance().bubbles().startAndJoinConference(m_room, new IConferenceProxy.IJoinAudioCallListener() { @Override public void onJoinAudioCallSuccess(String jingleJid) { if (m_room.getConference() != null) RainbowSdk.instance().webRTC().makeConferenceCall(m_room.getConference().getId(), jingleJid); // do something } @Override public void onJoinAudioCallFailed(IConferenceProxy.ConferenceError error) { // do something } }); If the user is not the owner of the bubble and if the conference is started, you should join this conference using: RainbowSdk.instance().bubbles().joinAudioConference(m_room, null, new IConferenceProxy.IJoinAudioCallListener() { @Override public void onJoinAudioCallSuccess(String jingleJid) { if (m_room.getConference() != null) RainbowSdk.instance().webRTC().makeConferenceCall(m_room.getConference().getId(), jingleJid); // do something } @Override public void onJoinAudioCallFailed(IConferenceProxy.ConferenceError error) { // do something } }); With theses 2 ways to join a conference, you have connected only in andio. Use video and desktop sharing in conference 3 different ways to take into account The user shares his video Another user shares his screen One or many users share their video. Of course, many combinations are possible as for example another user shares his desktop and another shares his video... When the user is connected in audio to the conference: if the user wants to add his own video, it should use the same method as classic web RTC : RainbowSDK.instance().webRTC().addVideo(); To drop his video, the user should use this method : RainbowSDK.instance().webRTC().dropVideo(); If another user shares his screen, there is nothing to do. The video will be automatically added. If another user shares his video, the user must subscribe to the video of this another user. To do it, you should use subscribeToVideo(Room room, ConferenceParticipant publisher, MultiVideoQuality multiVideoQuality, IConferenceProxy.ISubscribeParticipantVideoListener listener) multiVideoQuality only works if the publisher is in multi-video quality, use ConferenceParticipant.isMultiVideoQuality(). where is publisherId is the user id of the user that you want to subscribe the video. You should find this value in the ConferenceParticipant. In Room object, you can see a Conference object. The participants list is within the Conference object. To unsubscribe to a video, you should use RainbowSDK.instance().bubbles().unsubscribeToVideo(Room room, String publisherId); To subscribe to another video, you should just call the method subscribeToVideo and the video will be automatically changed. For information, each video is a new web RTC call. So, in a conference, we have tje audio call and one or two video calls. To manage correctly the display of each video, tou should use the method RainbowSdk.instance().webRTC().getStreams(PeerSession.PeerSessionType type) This method returns a list of Media streams Sessions can be : SessionDefinition AUDIO_VIDEO_SHARINGthe main call which contains the audio in conference mode SHARINGcal"

In this guide, we'll help you properly configure your application to receive Push Notifications sent by Rainbow. What You'll Learn In this tutorial, you'll learn how to: Set up your Firebase Project for Push Notifications: Learn how to configure Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for your Android project to enable Push Notifications. Configure Your Rainbow Project on the Developer's Site: Understand the steps required to configure your Rainbow project on the developer's site to enable Push Notifications. Handle Incoming Push Notifications Seamlessly: Implement methods to handle incoming Push Notifications seamlessly in your Android application, ensuring a smooth user experience. By mastering these steps, you'll be equipped to effectively enable and manage Push Notifications in your Android application using the Rainbow SDK, enhancing user engagement and interaction. Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have followed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before diving into notifications, make sure: Your development environment is set up according to the guidelines in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as explained in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have obtained the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. To be familiar with the Rainbow SDK In the context of the Rainbow platform, push notifications play a significant role in enabling real-time communication and collaboration features even when the application is not actively running. Here's how push notifications are utilized within the Rainbow ecosystem: Real-Time Communication: Rainbow allows users to stay connected and receive notifications for various events, such as new messages, incoming calls, or updates from their contacts. Push notifications ensure that users are promptly notified of these events, even if the Rainbow application is not currently in use. Message Notifications: Users receive push notifications for new messages received within Rainbow chat conversations. These notifications typically include details such as the sender's name, message preview, and options to quickly reply or view the message. Call Notifications: Incoming call notifications are sent via push notifications, alerting users to incoming voice or video calls. Users can then choose to accept or decline the call directly from the notification, even if the Rainbow application is not open. New Channel Messages: Push notifications are used to notify users about new messages posted in channels they are subscribed to. This ensures that users stay updated on important discussions and announcements happening within their channels. New Voice Message: Push notifications are used to notify users about new voice messages received on the voicemail. These notifications ensure that users are aware of incoming voice messages and can listen to them promptly. Webinar Invitation: Push notifications are used to receive invitations to webinars hosted on the Rainbow platform. These notifications provide essential details about the webinar, such as the topic, date, time, and instructions for joining, ensuring users are aware of and can participate in the webinar. Once you have met these prerequisites, you are ready to dive into the configuration and management of push notifications with the Rainbow SDK for Android. Let's get started! With the Rainbow SDK and Firebase Cloud Messaging, setting up push notifications is effortless and can be accomplished in just a few simple steps. Push messages are sent encrypted and decrypted by the SDK before being processed. Once processed, the usual notification channels are used. For more detailed information, please refer to: Which events are managed by push Manage notifications Step 1 - Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging To get started with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), follow these instructions: Follow the Firebase Tutorial: Visit Add Firebase to Your Android Project and follow the steps outlined in the tutorial. Configure Your Project: Ensure that your project is configured with a google-services.json file. This file contains important configuration details required for integrating Firebase services into your Android application. Place this file in the app directory of your project. Add Dependencies: Make sure to include all necessary dependencies for Firebase Cloud Messaging in your project. These dependencies are specified in the Firebase setup tutorial and are essential for enabling FCM functionality in your Android application. By the end of this step, your Android project should be properly configured to utilize Firebase Cloud Messaging, with the google-services.json file in place and all required dependencies added.

    "content": "DocumentationMake an IM conversationLTS release 2.61.0Published on 202-04-06Make an IM conversation This guide explains how to retrieve messages from a conversation (P2P or Bubble) and how to send new ones. Preamble This is the same mechanism for Peer to Peer messages and messages bubbles. Open a conversation To open a conversation from a contact or a room, you can call one of these methods. If the conversation is found locally, the method will just return it in the listener. Otherwise, it will be created before. 1. From a contact This method only needs the jabber identifier of your contact. IRainbowContact contact; // Your contact RainbowSdk.instance().im().getConversationFromContact(contact.getJid()); 2. From a room This method needs the Room object. Room room; // Your room object RainbowSdk.instance().im().getConversationFromRoom(room, new IRainbowGetConversationListener() { @Override public void onGetConversationSuccess(IRainbowConversation conversation) { // Do what you want with the conversation } @Override public void onGetConversationError() { // Manage the error } }); Delete a conversation To delete a conversation, you can call the method deleteConversation as following: RainbowSdk.instance().im().deleteConversation(your_conversation, new IConversationProxy.IDeleteConversationListener() { @Override public void onDeletionSuccess() { } @Override public void onDeletionError() { } }); NB: The conversation is only deleted from the active conversations list (the messages are not deleted). Send a conversation by email To send all messages from a conversation to the user login email, you can call the method sendConversationByEmail as following: RainbowSdk.instance().im().sendConversationByEmail(your_conversation, new IConversationProxy.ISendConversationByEmailListener() { @Override public void onSendConversationByEmailSuccess() { } @Override public void onSendConversationByEmailFailed(RainbowServiceException exception) { } }); Get the messages and listen to updates Getting messages from a conversation is done in three steps : First, call the API getMessagesFromConversation(IRainbowConversation conversation), Then listen to the messages list changes. See more in Guide Using ArrayItemList. Finally, call the method getMessages() on the IRainbowConversation object. You can do it by creating an IItemListChangeListener in the class and then register the listener. Here is a complete sample for getting messages from conversations: public class ConversationFragment extends Fragment { // Creating the listener private IItemListChangeListener m_changeListener = new IItemListChangeListener() { @Override public void dataChanged() { // Do something on the UI thread ArrayItemList<IMMessage> messages = m_conversation.getMessages(); } }; @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) { // Note that if the second parameter is ommitted, the method is returning the last 50 messages RainbowSdk.instance().im().getMessagesFromConversation(m_conversation, NB_MESSAGES_TO_RETRIEVE); // Here we register the listener m_conversation.getMessages().registerChangeListener(m_changeListener); return view; } @Override public void onDestroyView() { // Don't forget to unregister to avoid memory leaks m_conversation.getMessages().unregisterChangeListener(m_changeListener); super.onDestroyView(); } } Get more messages from a conversation All messages are not retrieved in one shot for performance reason. You need to retrieve them manually by calling the API getMoreMessagesFromConversation(). The GUI is updated by the IItemListChangeListener above RainbowSdk.instance().im().getMoreMessagesFromConversation(m_conversation, NB_MESSAGES_TO_RETRIEVE); Send a message to a conversation To send a message to a conversation, you just have to call the API sendMessageToConversation() with the IRainbowConversation. The GUI is updated by the IItemListChangeListener above. RainbowSdk.instance().im().sendMessageToConversation(m_conversation, \"your message\"); Be careful, you must send to the server that you read messages. Delivery state available for messages StateDescription SENTthe message is sent SENT_SERVER_RECEIVEDthe message sent is received by the server SENT_CLIENT_RECEIVEDthe message sent is received by the other client (but unread) SENT_CLIENT_READthe message sent is read by the other client RECEIVEDthe message received by me is correctly received (but unread) READthe message received by me is correctly read UNKNOWNthe message is in a unknown state For example when an IM is read, you may want to update GUI : IMMessage message // Your message if (message.deliveryState == DeliveryState.READ) { // Update your GUI } Mark a message as read When receiving a message, the SDK for Android automatically send a receipt of type received to your recipient. On your own, you need to send a receipt of type read when the message received has been read. To send a receipt of type read, you need to call the API ma"

Minimal permissions Before starting with WebRTC, you need to request the following permissions in your application: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\"/> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\"/> Here is how to do this: Request App Permissions All APIs are declared in RainbowSdk.instance().webRTC() Audio calls A WebRTC call can have only audio or audio and video in the same call. Rainbow SDk is able to handle only one WebRTC call at a time. This means that when there is already a call in progress, no new incoming call will be handled and you will not be able to make a second outgoing call. Incoming call To listen to incoming calls, you should register to ITelephonyListener listener. This listener implements 3 API which are onCallAdded(), onCallModified() and onCallRemoved(). To listen to it, you should use the following API registerTelephonyListener() in WebRTC module. Do not forget to unregister this listener to avoid memory leaks. You should call the API unregisterTelephonyListener() once you do not need anymore to listen these events. Here is the content of ITelephonyListener: @Override public void onCallAdded(WebRTCCall call) { RBLog.verbose(LOG_TAG, \"call addded\"); } @Override public void onCallModified(WebRTCCall call) { RBLog.verbose(LOG_TAG, \"call modified\"); } @Override public void onCallRemoved(WebRTCCall call) { RBLog.verbose(LOG_TAG, \"call removed\"); } To answer, when the onCallAdded() is triggered, you should call the API takeCall(). The first argument is a boolean which allows to know if you want to answer with video (true) or not - audio only (false). The second argument is a boolean which allows to know if you want to use front facing camera (true) or not - rear camera (false) If you want to reject the incoming call, you should call the API rejectCall(). This action runs when a call is in ringing state. The WebRTCCall object is the current WebRTC call. You will automaticvally get it using the listener ITelephonyListener or you can get it at any time using the API getCurrentCall(). This object contains all information related to the call. Here are the most important ones: getState() returns the current state of the call public enum MediaState { /** * The incoming call is ringing. */ RINGING_INCOMING, /** * The outgoing call is ringing. */ RINGING_OUTGOING, /** * The call is active (means in conversation). */ ACTIVE } getDistant() returns the IRainbowContact corresponding to the caller or the callee. getSubject() returns the subject of the call which is roughly the reason of the call. getTime() returns the duration in seconds of the call. getStartTime() returns the timestamp when the call has started. canAddVideo() returns true when it is possible to add video to the call. getUseFrontFacingCamera() returns true when the video is currently using the front facing camera. getEglBaseContext() returns the EglBase.Context needed by your application to render video of the call. Outgoing call To make audio calls, you should use the API makeCall(). This method has 4 arguments. You have to give your contact object, a boolean with a value which is false (for audio calls), a boolean with a value which is false (for front facing camera usage which is not used for audio calls) and the subject of the call. As soon as this method is called a onCallAdded() is triggered and you will get the WebRTCCall object representing your outgoing call. Active call When the call is answered on your side for incoming call or on the other side for outgoing call, the onCallModified() listener will be triggered and the WebRTCCall state will be updated to ACTIVE. To terminate the call, you should use the method hangupCall(). If you want to add video during a call, you should use the API addVideo(). The only argument is a boolean which allows to know if you want to use front facing camera (true) or not - rear camera (false) Video Calls Video calls are working exactly the same as audio calls. The only difference when using makeCall() or takeCall() is that you should use true for the first parameter if you want to start the call directly with video. Otherwise, as seen in previous section you can addVideo() to a simple audio call. Any video modification in the call will trigger a onCallModified(). Then you will need to update your video renderings according to what is available. To render videos, you need to use SurfaceViewRenderer objects that are provided by the WebRTC stack and you will need to initialize these object (init()) with the getEglBaseContext() from the current WebRTCCall. Then you will need to get VideoTrack objects (also provided by the WebRTC stack) and give them to the SurfaceViewRenderer. videoTrack.addSink(surfaceViewRenderer); Do not forget "

Minimal permissions Before starting with WebRTC and PBX calls, you need to request the following permissions in your application: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\"/> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\"/> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS\"/> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CALL_PHONE\"/> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\"/> Here is how to do this: Request App Permissions All APIs are declared in RainbowSdk.instance().telephony() Nomadic state Before making any PBX call, nomadic must be activated so that the device on which the application is running, is reachable by the PBX. It can be reachable through GSM or through WebRTC using WebRTC Gateway. To know if the device is reachable, just use the API isNomadicActivatedOnMyMobile(). If the returned value is true, nothing more is needed. If the returned value of isNomadicActivatedOnMyMobile() is false, you should use the API activateNomadic(). This method has one argument. You have to give a String corresponding either to the GSM number of the device or to the WebRTC Gateway number. To get this parameter, you should use the API getNomadicNumber(). This method has one argument. You have to give a boolean with a value which is true to get the WebRTC Gateway number if available. if (!isNomadicActivatedOnMyMobile()) { activateNomadic(getNomadicNumber(true)); } On some devices, the method getNomadicNumber() will not be able to get the GSM number. You will need to give the correct value to the activateNomadic() by another way (asking the user or something else). You can also deactivate the nomadic by calling the API deactivateNomadic(). The device will then be no more reachable by the PBX. To listen to nomadic changes, you should register to INomadicStatusChangeListener listener. This listener implements 2 API which are onNomadicStatusChanged() and onNomadicStatusError(). To listen to it, you should use the API registerNomadicStatusChangeListener() in telephony module. To unregister for this event, you should call the API unregisterNomadicStatusChangeListener(). Here is the content of INomadicStatusChangeListener: /** * Nomadic has changed. This is called after activateNomadic or deactivateNomadic */ void onNomadicStatusChanged(); /** * Nomadic error. This is called after activateNomadic or deactivateNomadic */ void onNomadicStatusError(); Incoming call To listen to incoming calls, you should register to ISessionsToDisplayChangeListener listener. This listener implements 4 API which are allSessionsRemoved(), sessionAdded(), sessionUpdated() and sessionRemoved(). To listen to it, you should use the API registerSessionsToDisplayListener() in telephony module. To unregister for this event, you should call the API unregisterSessionsToDisplayListener(). Here is the result of ISessionsToDisplayChangeListener: void allSessionsRemoved(); void sessionAdded(ISession session); void sessionRemoved(ISession session); void sessionUpdated(ISession session); To answer to a PBX call, when the sessionAdded() is triggered, if the ISession MediaState is RINGING_INCOMING, you should call the API takeCall(). The only argument is an ISession which represents the call you want to answer. You can also deflect an incoming call to any internal number by using deflectCallTo(). You can use here any othe number from your PBX. Finally, you can deflect an incoming call to voicemail by using deflectCallToVoicemail(). The user must have a voicemail. The ISession object represents a PBX call. You will automatically get one using the listener ISessionsToDisplayChangeListener or you can get them at any time using the API getSessionsToDisplay(). Rainbow SDK can handle up to 2 PBX calls, this means that you can get up to 2 ISession objects. Here is the most important content of an ISession: /** * @return MediaState of this session. */ MediaState getState(); /** * @return Contact[] the participant to this session. */ Contact[] getParticipants(); /** * @return int of the duration in seconds. */ int getTime(); /** * @return long the call start time */ long getStartTime(); /** * @return boolean to determine if the session is a conference or not (check the number of participants) */ boolean isConference(); /** * @return boolean to know if the MediaState.HELD of the call is a result of the distant */ boolean isHeldByDistant(); /** * @return String the subject of the call if any */ String getCallSubject(); /** * @return String the global call id. */ String getGlobalCallId(); /** * @return String the correlator data. */ String getCorrelatorData(); And here are the different values that getState() can have: public enum MediaState { /** * The incoming call is ringing. */ RINGING_INCOMING, /** *"

This guide will walk you through how to handle call logs in your application, including managing missed call logs, grouping call logs by contact, and handling call logs for hunting groups. Rainbow conceptDescription CallLogRepresents an individual call log entry, including details such as call duration, date, and contact. Missed Call LogsRepresents a collection of call logs that have not been answered. These are a subset of all call logs, filtered to show only missed calls. CallLogGroupRepresents a grouping of call logs associated with a specific contact. This helps in organizing and managing call logs by contact. Read StatusIndicates whether a call log has been read or not. Managing read status is essential for tracking which calls have been answered. GroupCallLogRepresents call logs specific to hunting groups. Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have completed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials, and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before diving into call log management, ensure the following: Your development environment is set up according to the guidelines provided in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as described in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. With these prerequisites met, you're ready to manage call logs using the Rainbow SDK for Android. In this guide, we will cover how to retrieve, filter, and manage call logs, including handling missed call logs, grouping logs by contact, and working with hunting group call logs. Retrieve the list of user call logs To retrieve the list of call logs for the logged-in user, simply call the following API in the CallLogs module. This API fetches the data from the server, limited to the last 75 entries, to optimize both memory usage and server load. kotlin java RainbowSdk().callLogs().fetchCallLogs(object : RainbowListener<List<CallLog>, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: List<CallLog>) { // You can directly use data // Or you can use `RainbowSdk().callLogs().callLogs` } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle error } }) RainbowSdk.instance().callLogs().fetchCallLogs(new RainbowListener<List<CallLog>, Unit>() { @Override public void onSuccess(List<CallLog> data) { // You can directly use data // Or you can use `RainbowSdk().callLogs().callLogs` } @Override public void onError(@NonNull RainbowError<Unit> error) { // Handle error } }); Once the fetch is complete, the RainbowSdk().callLogs().callLogs property contains the user's latest call logs, sorted in descending date order (most recent first). Note: You can listen to changes in the call log list using the following: kotlin java private val callLogListener = IItemListChangeListener { // Handle updates } RainbowSdk().callLogs().callLogs.registerChangeListener(callLogListener) // ... // Don't forget to call unregisterChangeListener to avoid memory leaks RainbowSdk().callLogs().callLogs.unregisterChangeListener(callLogListener) private final IItemListChangeListener callLogListener = () -> { // Handle updates }; RainbowSdk.callLogs().getCallLogs().registerChangeListener(callLogListener); // ... // Don't forget to call unregisterChangeListener to avoid memory leaks RainbowSdk.callLogs().getCallLogs().unregisterChangeListener(callLogListener); If you need to retrieve call logs for a specific contact, use the following methods: RainbowSdk().callLogs().getCallLogsGroupForContact(contactUniqueId) RainbowSdk().callLogs().getMissedCallLogsGroupForContact(contactUniqueId) These methods perform a local search for the call logs related to the contact. Note that these methods do not fetch data from the server but provide access to the locally available call logs. For additional ways to manage these call logs, you have access to the following properties: missedCallLogs: This property contains all the missed call logs. It allows you to focus specifically on calls that were not answered. groupedCallLogs: This property contains all the call logs grouped by contact. It organizes call logs in a way that lets you easily see all interactions with a specific contact. groupedMissedCallLogs: This property contains all the missed call logs grouped by contact, enabling you to track missed interactions with specific contacts effectively. These three properties are not instances of ArrayItemList, so you can't listen to changes directly on them. However, they are updated automatically whenever the callLogs property is updated. Mark Call Logs as Read There are several ways to mark call logs as read, depending on the level of specificity you need. Here are three common scenarios: Mark all call logs as read: This scenario is useful if you want to mark all call logs as read when you exi"

This guide will walk you through how to handle favorite contacts and rooms in your application, including adding, removing, and listening to changes in the favorite list. Rainbow conceptDescription IRainbowFavoriteRepresents a favorite entry, which can either be a contact or a room. PeerIdRepresents the unique identifier (id) of the contact or room stored in the IRainbowFavorite object. PeerTypeAn enum that specifies the type of favorite. It differentiates between a Contact and a Room. For contacts, there are several subtypes: - UserRepresents a standard Rainbow user in the contact list. - BotRepresents an automated bot account in the contact list. - DirectoryRepresents a contact coming from a corporate directory. - Office365Represents a contact synchronized from Office 365. ArrayItemListRepresents a list that contains the user's favorites (both contacts and rooms). This list can be observed for changes, allowing you to react when favorites are added, removed, or updated. Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have completed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials, and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before diving into favorites management, ensure the following: Your development environment is set up according to the guidelines provided in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as described in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. With these prerequisites met, you're ready to manage your favorites using the Rainbow SDK for Android. In this guide, we will cover how to add contacts or rooms to your favorites, remove favorites, and listen for changes in the favorites list. Retrieve favorites The SDK automatically retrieves the list of favorites after the user is authenticated. However, if you need to manually refresh the favorites list at any point, you can use the fetchFavorites() method from the Favorites module. This method accepts a listener that allows you to access the list of IRainbowFavorite objects returned by the server. If you prefer, you can also omit the listener if you have already subscribed to changes on the favorites property of the module, which automatically updates when the favorites list changes. RainbowSdk().favorites().fetchFavorites(object : RainbowListener<List<IRainbowFavorite>, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: List<IRainbowFavorite>) { // handle success } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // handle error } }) Otherwise, you can simply use the favorites property: RainbowSdk().favorites().favorites To listen for changes in the favorites list and be notified when an update occurs, you can register a change listener as shown below: private val favoritesChangeListener = IItemListChangeListener { // Handle update in the list } RainbowSdk().favorites().favorites.registerChangeListener(favoritesChangeListener) Remember to unregister the listener when it's no longer needed to avoid memory leaks: RainbowSdk().favorites().favorites.unregisterChangeListener(favoritesChangeListener) Create a new Favorite To create a favorite, you can use one of the following methods: createFavorite(peerId: String, type: PeerType, position: Int? = null, listener: RainbowListener<IRainbowFavorite, CreateFavoriteError>? = null) fun createFavoriteFromContact(contact: IRainbowContact, position: Int? = null, listener: RainbowListener<IRainbowFavorite, CreateFavoriteError>? = null) The first method allows you to create any type of favorite by specifying the PeerType. The second method creates a favorite from a contact, automatically resolving the appropriate PeerType based on the contact. It's important to note that having the correct PeerType is essential for correctly resolving the contact's information. Both methods accept an optional parameter to specify the position at which the favorite is added. If the position is not specified or is out of bounds, the favorite is added at the end of the list. val peerId = \"contactOrRoomId\" val peerType = PeerType.User // Could also be PeerType.Room, PeerType.Bot, etc. val position: Int? = 0 // Optional, null to add to the end of the list RainbowSdk().favorites().createFavorite(peerId, peerType, position, object : RainbowListener<IRainbowFavorite, CreateFavoriteError> { override fun onSuccess(data: IRainbowFavorite) { // Handle successful creation of favorite println(\"Favorite created: ${data.peerId}\") } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<CreateFavoriteError>) { // Handle error println(\"Error creating favorite: $error\") } }) val contact: IRainbowContact = getSelectedContact() // Assume this returns a valid contact RainbowSdk().favorites().createFavoriteFromContact(contact, listener = object : RainbowListener<IRainbowFavorite, CreateFavoriteError> { overrid"

Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have followed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before diving into notifications, make sure: Your development environment is set up according to the guidelines in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as explained in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have obtained the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. To be familiar with the Rainbow SDK To respond to events reported by the SDK, it is recommended to use a dedicated class for registering listeners across different modules based on your application's requirements. Creating a central management class within your Application class offers several advantages. This approach consolidates the handling of notifications, providing a centralized and organized structure. One key benefit is the accessibility of notifications, even when the application is running in the background. By centralizing the management of events, your application gains consistency and ease of maintenance, enhancing the overall robustness of event-driven functionalities. This allows you to display Android notifications or perform custom actions as needed. Creation of a NotificationCenter class Please note that the provided example is a template for implementation. Feel free to adjust it according to your specific needs or explore alternative approaches that better suit your application's architecture. kotlin java class NotificationCenter(private val applicationContext: Context) : Channels.IChannelsListener, Im.IRainbowImListener { // Define a channel ID for notifications private val sampleChannelID = \"SAMPLE_CHANNEL_ID\" // Initialize the NotificationCenter and register the desired listeners fun start() { val notificationManager = applicationContext.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager? notificationManager?.createNotificationChannel(NotificationChannel(sampleChannelID, \"Default notification\", NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT)) RainbowSdk().channels().registerChannelsListener(this) RainbowSdk().im().registerListener(this) } // Stop the NotificationCenter by unregistering all listeners fun stop() { RainbowSdk().channels().unregisterChannelsListener(this) RainbowSdk().im().unregisterListener(this) } } class NotificationCenter implements Notifications.INotificationListener, Im.IRainbowImListener { // Define a channel ID for notifications private final String sampleChannelID = \"SAMPLE_CHANNEL_ID\"; private final Context applicationContext; public NotificationCenter(Context applicationContext) { this.applicationContext = applicationContext; } // Initialize the NotificationCenter and register the desired listeners public void start() { NotificationManager notificationManager = (NotificationManager) applicationContext.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE); if (notificationManager != null) { notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(new NotificationChannel(sampleChannelID, \"Default notification\", NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT)); } RainbowSdk.instance().channels().registerChannelsListener(this); RainbowSdk.instance().im().registerListener(this); } // Stop the NotificationCenter by unregistering all listeners public void stop() { RainbowSdk.instance().channels().unregisterChannelsListener(this); RainbowSdk.instance().im().unregisterListener(this); } } Once the class has been created, you need to initialize it in your "

    "content": "DocumentationManage tasks and pin messagesLTS release 2.61.0Published on 202-04-06Manage tasks and pin messages Welcome to the Rainbow SDK for Android guide: Managing Tasks and Pinning Messages. This guide will help you manage user task lists, including how to create tasks, convert messages into tasks, update tasks, and listen for changes in the task list. Additionally, you will learn how to pin messages in a conversation so that they are visible to all participants. Rainbow conceptDescription TaskA task is a \"to-do\" item, specific to the user. It can be created by specifying a title and an optional description, or by converting a message from a conversation into a task. Tasks are organized by category. IMMessageAn IMMessage refers to any message sent in a conversation. These messages can be added directly to a user's task list. PinMessageA PinMessage is a message that has been pinned within a conversation. All participants can see pinned messages, though in Room conversations (with multiple participants), only organizers can pin messages. PeerA peer is a participant in a conversation. The Peer object includes the ID of the user who pinned the message in the case of a PinMessage. Preamble This tutorial assumes you have already completed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials and have an active Rainbow application. Before proceeding with task and pinned message management, ensure that the following prerequisites are met: Your development environment is correctly set up, following the guidelines in the Getting Started tutorial. Your application is successfully connected to the Rainbow platform, as outlined in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have the necessary authentication credentials and API keys available. Once these prerequisites are in place, you're ready to start managing tasks and pinned messages using the Rainbow SDK for Android. Retrieve user tasks The tasks of the connected user are loaded when the SDK starts, but only in a minimal version to provide the task list. Additional information that may be found in a task such as the associated IRainbowContact, the associated IRainbowRoom, the RainbowFileDescriptor, or the IMMessage itself—are not loaded at startup for performance reasons. To access these tasks, simply use: RainbowSdk().tasks().taskList, which returns an ArrayItemList<Task>, allowing you to listen for real-time changes. private val tasksListener = IItemListChangeListener { RainbowSdk().tasks().taskList.copyOfDataList // Contains the latest updates to the task list } RainbowSdk().tasks().taskList.registerChangeListener(tasksListener) // Don't forget to unregister the listener later RainbowSdk().tasks().taskList.unregisterChangeListener(tasksListener) To retrieve all available information in the tasks, or to refresh the list, you can use the method fetchTasks(category: String? = null, listener: RainbowListener<Map<String, List<Task>>, Unit>? = null). This method accepts an optional category parameter, allowing you to retrieve tasks only from a specific category. If the parameter is omitted, all tasks are retrieved. You can also pass a listener as a callback to handle the list of tasks grouped by category. This parameter can also be omitted if you're already listening for changes in the task list. RainbowSdk().tasks().fetchTasks(listener = object : RainbowListener<Map<String, List<Task>>, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: Map<String, List<Task>>) { // Handle success } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle error } }) Create a new task There are two ways to create a task: Directly Creating a Task: You can use the method createTask(text: String, category: String, additionalDescription: String? = null, position: Int? = 0, listener: RainbowListener<Task, TaskRepository.CreateTaskError>? = null) to create a task by providing the task’s title (text) and its category (category). Additionally, you can specify an optional description and a position within the category. In the example below, a task is created in the \"High\" category without specifying a position, so it will be added at the top of the list. RainbowSdk().tasks().createTask( text = \"My new task!\", category = \"High\", listener = object : RainbowListener<Task, TaskRepository.CreateTaskError> { override fun onSuccess(data: Task) { // Handle success } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<TaskRepository.CreateTaskError>) { // Handle error } } ) Creating a Task from a Message: The second way to create a task is by converting an IMMessage into a task using the method createTaskFromMessage(message: IMMessage, conversation: IRainbowConversation, category: String, position: Int? = 0, listener: RainbowListener<Task, TaskRepository.CreateTaskError>? = null). When you pass a message and its associated conversation as parameters, the task will be linked to the message, and its content will reflect it. You can also specify the task's position within the category. RainbowSdk().tasks().createTaskFromMessage( me"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging alertsLTS release 2.61.0Published on 202-04-06Managing Alerts and Devices The Alerts module allows you to create devices represented by the AlertDevice object. This AlertDevice can then receive alerts based on the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). By using this module, users can efficiently manage their devices and handle alerts effectively. Rainbow conceptDescription AlertDeviceRepresents a device that can receive alerts. It contains properties such as device ID, name, type, and user information. AlertTemplateA template for alerts, containing details such as the alert's title, description, urgency, and other metadata. Preamble Before using the Alerts module, ensure that: Your development environment is correctly set up, following the guidelines in the Getting Started tutorial. Your application is successfully connected to the Rainbow platform, as outlined in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have the necessary authentication credentials and API keys available. Once these prerequisites are in place, you are ready to manage alerts and devices using the Rainbow SDK for Android. Fetch devices To retrieve a list of devices associated with the user account, use the fetchDevices() method. This method will return the devices that will receive alerts. Here’s an example of how to fetch devices: RainbowSdk().alerts().fetchDevices(object : RainbowListener<AlertDevicesData, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: AlertDevicesData) { // Handle the list of AlertDevice instances val devices = data.data val totalDevices = data.total val limit = data.limit val offset = data.offset // Use the devices list, for example, display them in the UI devices.forEach { device -> println(\"Device ID: ${device.id}, Device Name: ${device.name}\") } // Handle pagination if necessary println(\"Total devices: $totalDevices, Limit: $limit, Offset: $offset\") } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle the error if the fetch fails } }) Create an AlertDevice To create a new AlertDevice, use the createDevice() method. Here’s an example of how to create an AlertDevice: val alertDevice = AlertDevice( id = \"device_id_123\", name = \"My Device\", type = \"android\", userId = \"user_id_456\", companyId = \"company_id_789\", jidIm = \"device_jid_im\", creationDate = Date() ) RainbowSdk().alerts().createDevice(alertDevice, object : RainbowListener<AlertDevice, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: AlertDevice) { // Handle success } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle error } }) Update an AlertDevice To update an existing device associated with the user account, use the updateDevice() method. Here’s an example of how to update an alert device: val updatedAlertDevice = alertDevice.copy(name = \"Updated Device Name\") RainbowSdk().alerts().updateDevice(updatedAlertDevice, object : RainbowListener<AlertDevice, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: AlertDevice) { // Handle the updated alert device } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle the error if update fails } }) Delete an AlertDevice To remove a device associated with the user account, use the deleteDevice() method. Here’s an example of how to delete an alert device: RainbowSdk().alerts().deleteDevice(\"device-id\", object : RainbowListener<Unit, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: Unit) { // Handle successful deletion } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle the error if deletion fails } }) Sending Acknowledgements To send read and received acknowledgements for alerts, use the following methods. These acknowledgements should ideally be sent in a part of the application that survives even when the UI is destroyed. Send Read Acknowledge To indicate that an alert has been presented to the user (via notification or otherwise), use the sendReadAcknowledge() method: RainbowSdk().alerts().sendReadAcknowledge(alertTemplate) // This should be called when the alert has been presented to the user. Send Received Acknowledge To acknowledge that an alert has been received, use the sendReceivedAcknowledge() method: RainbowSdk().alerts().sendReceivedAcknowledge(alertTemplate) // This should be called as soon as the alert is received. Send Alert Feedback To send feedback regarding an alert, use the sendAlertFeedback() method: RainbowSdk().alerts().sendAlertFeedback( deviceId = \"device-id\", alertId = \"alert-id\", answerId = \"answer-id\", listener = object : RainbowListener<Unit, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: Unit) { // Handle successful feedback submission } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle the error if feedback submission fails } } ) Registering for Alert Notifications To receive alert notifications, you need to register a change listener. This listener will notify your application whenever an alert notification is received. Here's how to register an alert notification listener: val alertsListener = object : IAlertNotificationListener { override fun onAlertNotificationReceived(alertTemplate: AlertTempl"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging bubblesLTS release 2.47.0Published on 2024-04-20Managing bubbles Preamble This guide explains how to manage bubbles and to discuss within them. Creation, archiving and deletion This first part of the guide will explain how to create, archive and delete a bubble. Create a new bubble To create a new bubble, you have to use the method createBubble(String name, String description, boolean disableNotifications, IRoomProxy.IRoomCreationListener listener) as following: disableNotifications is used for disabling notifications. For xxl bubbles, it is a good idea to put this boolean to true. RainbowSdk.instance().bubbles().createBubble(\"Room name\", \"Room description\", disableNotifications, new IRoomProxy.IRoomCreationListener() { @Override public void onCreationSuccess(Room room) { // Do something in the thread UI } @Override public void onCreationFailed(RoomCreationError error) { // Do something in the thread UI } }); Archive (or close) a bubble To archive a bubble, you have to use the method archiveBubble(Room room, IRoomProxy.IChangeUserRoomDataListener listener) as following below. An archived bubble can still be read but nobody can post new messages. RainbowSdk.instance().bubbles().archiveBubble(room, new IRoomProxy.IChangeUserRoomDataListener() { @Override public void onChangeUserRoomDataSuccess(RoomParticipant roomParticipant) { } @Override public void onChangeUserRoomDataFailed() { } }); Two possible cases: You are the owner: all participants are archived (the bubble is closed) You are a participant: you are the only one archived (you leave the bubble) Delete a bubble To delete a bubble, you have to use the method deleteBubble(Room room, IRoomProxy.IDeleteRoomListener listener) as following: RainbowSdk.instance().bubblez().archiveBubble(room, new IRoomProxy.IDeleteRoomListener() { @Override public void onRoomDeletedSuccess() { } @Override public void onRoomDeletedFailed() { } }); Invitation To be able to discuss with users in a Rainbow bubble, you need to invite them into that bubble. This part will explain how to do that. Invite a user in a bubble You can use one of these methods to invite one or more users in a bubble: One participant: addParticipantToBubble(Room room, IRainbowContact contact, IRoomProxy.IAddParticipantsListener listener) More participants: addParticipantsToBubble(Room room, List<IRainbowContact> contacts, IRoomProxy.IAddParticipantsListener listener) For example, if you want to invite only one participant, you can do as following: RainbowSdk.instance().bubbles.addParticipantToBubble(room, contact, new IRoomProxy.IAddParticipantsListener() { @Override public void onAddParticipantsSuccess() { } @Override public void onMaxParticipantsReached() { } @Override public void onAddParticipantFailed(Contact contactFailed) { } }); Remove a user from a bubble If you are a Moderator, you can remove a user from a bubble. A member removed can still have access to the bubble to see existing messages posted before he was removed, but can not see new messages posted after he has been removed and can not post new message too. To remove a contact from a bubble, you have to use the method deleteParticipantFromBubble(Room room, IRainbowContact contact, IRoomPRoxy.IDeleteParticipantListener listener) as following: RainbowSdk.instance().bubbles().deleteParticipantFromBubble(room, contact, new IRoomProxy.IDeleteparticipantListener() { @Override public void onDeleteParticipantSuccess(String roomId, String participantIdDeleted) { } @Override public void onDeleteParticipantFailure() { } }); Accept an invitation to a bubble To accept an invitation to a bubble (in the pending Bubbles list), you have to use the API acceptInvitation(Room room, IChangeUserRoomDataListener listener) as following: RainbowSdk.instance().bubbles().acceptInvitation(room, new IRoomProxy.IChangeUserRoomDataListener() { @Override public void onChangeUserRoomDataSuccess(RoomParticipant roomParticipant) { } @Override public void onChangeUserRoomDataFailed() { } }); Reject an invitation to a bubble To reject an invitation to a bubble (in the pending Bubbles list), you have to use the method rejectInvitation(Room room, IChangeUserRoomDataListener listener) as following: RainbowSdk.instance().bubbles().rejectInvitation(room, new IRoomProxy.IChangeUserRoomDataListener() { @Override public void onChangeUserRoomDataSuccess(RoomParticipant roomParticipant) { } @Override public void onChangeUserRoomDataFailed() { } }); Discuss in a bubble In ordre to discuss in a bubble, you first have to get or create a conversation associated to this bubble. You can do that as following: RainbowSdk.instance().im().getConversationFromRoom(room); Then, you just have to do the same as a peer to peer conversation (see Make an IM conversation guide). If you need more information about the Bubble, just get the Bubble object using method getBubble() in the conversation. Listen to bubbles changes You can listen to the data changed of the list getAllBubbles()"

Channels offer the possibility to share information to a large numbers of users. The policy and behavior of a channel is defined by its mode. More details in the Creating channels section. In a channel, an user has a role that defines his rights. More details in the Adding and removing users section. Retrieving the list of existing channels Once connected to Rainbow, the SDK for Android will automatically retrieve the user's channels (owned and subscribed channels). To access the channels list, you have to call getAllUserChannels() and register a change listener to it: RainbowSdk.instance().channels().registerChangeListener(() -> { // do something with the result of this list RainbowSdk.instance().channels().getAllUserChannels(); }); Others methods like getAllOwnedChannels() and getAllSubscribedChannels() are available to only get channels you own or channels where you have subscribed. Each time you create, subscribe, unsubscribe or delete a channel, this list will be updated. 'All user channels' represents only the user's channels. If you want to explore public channels, you have to use fetchChannelsByName() or fetchChannelsByDescription(), see searching for a public channel section. Retrieve a channel by its id If you know the id of an existing channel, you can access to the channel by calling the getChannelById() method: (Note : this method only search in local list) RainbowSdk.instance().channels().getChannelById(channelId); Creating channels You can create two sort of channels: Public and Closed. Channel modeDescription PublicAll users of the company can search, consult, subscribe and unsubscribe this channel. ClosedOnly an Owner can add users to the channel. Invitation is forced and users can't unsubscribe. Created channels are affiliated to your company and can't be seen by an other company. Create public channel Public channels can be created with the createPublicChannel() method. String name = \"My public channel\"; String description = \"My description\"; String category = \"Information\"; RainbowSdk.instance().channels().createPublicChannel(name, description, category, new RainbowListener<Channel, Unit>() { @Override public void onSuccess(Channel data) { // Do something } @Override public void onError(@NonNull RainbowError<Unit> error) { // Do something with the exception } }); Five types of mode is possible for a channel: Channel modeDescription company_publicOnly users in the company can search, consult, subscribe and unsubscribe this channel. company_privateOnly on invitation. Only company users can be invited. Users who have accepted the invitation can receive incoming messages company_closedOnly on invitation, but the users doesn't have choice to accept/decline (forced invitation). Users can't unsubscribe. all_publicBoth company and rainbow users can search, consult, subscribe and unsubscribe this channel. all_privateOnly on invitation.

    "content": "DocumentationOrganize your roomsLTS release 2.61.0Published on 202-04-06Organize your rooms Welcome to the Rainbow SDK for Android guide on organizing rooms into containers. This guide will help you classify user rooms into containers, allowing for better organization and efficient access. Rainbow conceptDescription RoomA room is a group conversation that includes multiple contacts, allowing for collaborative discussions. ContainerA container functions as a folder to store and categorize rooms, making it easier to manage and locate conversations. Preamble This tutorial assumes that you have completed the Getting Started and Connect to Rainbow tutorials, and that you have an active Rainbow application. Before proceeding with room organization and container management, please ensure the following: Your development environment is set up according to the guidelines provided in the Getting Started tutorial. You have successfully connected your application to the Rainbow platform as described in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have the necessary authentication credentials and API keys. With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to manage containers and organize rooms using the Rainbow SDK for Android. In this guide, we will cover: Creating, updating, and deleting containers Adding rooms to containers Removing rooms from containers Listening to containers changes Retrieve user containers The user's containers are automatically retrieved after the user has authenticated. The SDK calls the method RainbowSdk().roomContainer().fetchContainers(), which retrieves the first 300 containers by default. The API supports pagination, so if the user has more than 300 containers, you can call this method yourself and specify either a larger limit or a different offset. You can also specify SORT_ASCENDING or SORT_DESCENDING to sort by container name. suspend fun fetchContainers( @IntRange(from = 1) limit: Int = DEFAULT_LIMIT_FETCH_CONTAINER, @IntRange(from = 0) offset: Int = 0, @SortOrder sortOrder: Int = SORT_ASCENDING ) : RainbowResult<List<Container>> You can use this method from a coroutine scope, and it returns a RainbowResult<List<Container>>. // Example usage in a coroutine scope viewModelScope.launch { RainbowSdk().roomContainers().fetchContainers(limit = 100, offset = 100) .onSuccess { containers -> // Here you have access to the list of containers } .onFailure { // Handle error } } If you want to retrieve information about a specific container, you can use the following method: RainbowSdk().roomContainer().fetchContainerById(containerId). These methods are considered lazy to avoid loading more than necessary. By default, a Container only contains the IDs of the rooms it holds. If you want to resolve these Room objects, you can call the following method: suspend fun fetchRoomsForContainerIfNeeded( container: Container ) : RainbowResult<List<IRainbowRoom>> This method first checks the cache to see if the rooms are available. If not, it attempts to resolve them via an API call. You need to call this method if, for example, you want to display the rooms within a container. // Example of retrieving rooms from a container viewModelScope.launch { RainbowSdk().roomContainers().fetchRoomsForContainerIfNeeded(container) .onSuccess { rooms -> // Here you have access to the list of rooms in the container } .onFailure { // Handle error } } Observe containers list RainbowSdk().roomContainers().containers is a property of type StateFlow<List<Container>>. It is a hot flow that produces the updated list of containers whenever an event modifies the user's containers. The flow starts when the user is authenticated and can be used until the user logs out or exits the application. You can observe this flow to get real-time updates whenever the containers list changes. // Example of observing the containers list viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch { repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) { RainbowSdk().roomContainer().containers.collect { containers -> // Do something with containers list } } } Create a new container You can create a new container using the createContainer() method. A container must have a name between 1 and 64 characters, and it may have an optional description up to 255 characters. Additionally, during the creation, you can specify a list of room IDs to directly add rooms to the container. Note: Rooms can also be added to an existing container after it has been created, so it is not mandatory to add them during container creation. // Example of creating a new container with rooms viewModelScope.launch { val roomIds = roomsToAdd.map { it.id } // Get list of room IDs to add to the container RainbowSdk().roomContainer().createContainer(\"A name\", \"Description\", roomIds) .onSuccess { // Handle success: The container was successfully created } .onFailure { error -> when { error.detailsCode == Failure.DUPLICATE_CONTAINER_NAME -> { // Handle error: Container name must be unique } error.detailsCode == Failure.MA"

ArrayItemList<IRainbowConversation> conversations = RainbowSdk.instance().im().getAllConversations(); for(IRainbowConversation conversation : conversations.getCopyOfDatalist()) { if (conversation.isRoomType()) { // The conversation is a bubble / room } else { // The conversation is a peer to peer conversation (one-to-one) } } For listening to message list changes of the conversation, you can register a listener String conversationId = \"\"; // Id of your conversation IRainbowConversation conversation = RainbowSdk.instance().im().getConversationFromId(conversationId); conversation.getMessages().registerChangeListener(new IItemListChangeListener() { @Override public void dataChanged() { //do stuff here } }); Retrieving contacts To retrieve the list of your contacts (they are in your network), you can call the method getRainbowContacts() but you have to listen to the contacts list changes. See more in Guide ArrayItemList. You can do that by creating an IItemListChangeListener object in the class which is listening and then register. public class MyFragmentWhichIsListeningConversations extends Fragment { private IItemListChangeListener m_changeListener = new IItemListChangeListener() { @Override public void dataChanged() { // Do something on the thread UI ArrayItemList<IRainbowContact> contacts = RainbowSdk.instance().contacts().getRainbowContacts(); } }; @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) { RainbowSdk.instance().contacts().getRainbowContacts().registerChangeListener(m_changeListener); return view; } @Override public void onDestroyView() { RainbowSdk().instance().contacts().getRainbowContacts().unregisterChangeListener(m_changeListener); super.onDestroyView(); } } Retrieve a contact information To retrieve an existing contact, you can call the method getContactFromJabberId or getContactFromId as following: IRainbowContact contact; contact = RainbowSdk.instance().contacts().getContactFromId(\"contactId\"); contact = RainbowSdk.instance().contacts().getContactFromJabberId(\"contactJabberId\"); If the contact searched is not found in your roster, you can call the method getUserDataFromId which will make a request to the server to retrieve the contact (limited - depending on privacy rules). RainbowSdk.instance().contacts().getUserDataFromId(\"contactId\", new IUserProxy.IGetUserDataListener() { @Override public void onSuccess(Contact contact) { // Do something with the retrieved contact from server } @Override public void onFailure(RainbowServiceException exception) { // Something was wrong } }); RainbowServiceException is an object that contain a status code, a details code and a details message about the exception threw : RainbowServiceException exception; // The exception exception.getStatusCode(); // Example : 404 for http not found error exception.getDetailsCode(); // Example : 404116 for more information about error exception.getDetailsMessage(); // A text message about this error Managing contact updates If you want to listen to contact updates, you have to implement IRainbowContact.IContactListener. public class MyFragmentWhichIsListeningToContactUpdates implement IRainbowContact.IContactListener { private IRainbowContact my_contact; // Your contact object @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) { my_contact.registerChangeListener(this); return view; } @Override public void onDestroyView() { // Don't forget to unregister the listener my_contact.unregisterChangeListener(this); super.onDestroyView(); } @Override pu"

This tutorial will explain how to use the FileStorage service for sharing files in Rainbow. Preamble All files shared with others Rainbow users are stored on Rainbow until you decide to remove it. To avoid bad usage and depending your profile, you have some limitations. The following table sums-up the size allowed depending on your profile: ProfileQuotaDetails Essential1 GBYou can share on Rainbow up to 1 GB of files Business1 GBYou can share on Rainbow up to 1 GB of files Enterprise20 GBYou can share on Rainbow up to 20 GB of files The following table shows the other specifications applied to any profile: LimitationLimitDetails File Size100 MBYou can share files with size lower than 100 MB Files NumberNo limitYou can share as many files as your want limited to your quota Knowing the file sharing quota In order to know if you can share a new file, you can call the API getUserQuotaConsumption(IFileProxy.IGetConsumptionListener listener). The return is a Consumption object, containing following values: RainbowSdk.instance().fileStorage().getUserQuotaConsumption(new IFileProxy.IGetConsumptionListener() { @Override public void onGetSuccess(Consumption consumption) { // Maximum of size allowed long quota = consumption.getQuota(); // Current total size of files uploaded long currentConsumption = consumption.getConsumption(); // Unit used String unit = consumption.getUnit(); } @Override public void onGetError() { } }); Sharing a file with a Rainbow user In a conversation with a Rainbow user, you can share a file by calling the API uploadFileToConversation as following: RainbowSdk.instance().fileStorage().uploadFileToConversation(the_conversation_object, the_uri_file, \"Your message\", new IFileProxy.IUploadFileListener() { @Override public void onUploadSuccess(RainbowFileDescriptor fileDescriptor) { } @Override public void onUploadInProgress(int percent) { } @Override public void onUploadFailed(RainbowFileDescriptor fileDescriptor, RainbowServiceException exception) { } }); Sharing a file within a bubble Sharing a file within a Bubble can be done as simply as with a contact by calling the API uploadFileToBubble: RainbowSdk.instance().fileStorage().uploadFileToBubble(the_room_object, the_uri_file, \"Your message\", new IFileProxy.IUploadFileListener() { @Override public void onUploadSuccess(RainbowFileDescriptor fileDescriptor) { } @Override public void onUploadInProgress(int percent) { } @Override public void onUploadFailed(RainbowFileDescriptor fileDescriptor, RainbowServiceException exception) { } }); Be notified of a new file shared As the file shared is relayed through a chat message, you can listen to new messages. See more: Make an IM conversation, chapter Get the messages and listen to updates Use the method isFileDescriptorAvailable() on the IMMessage object and then, if not null, use getFileDescriptor(). if (yourImMessage.isFileDescriptorAvailable()) { RainbowFileDescriptor fileDescriptor = yourImMessage.getFileDescriptor(); } Downloading a file Files are protected in Rainbow. If you want to download a file, you need to be signed and call the API downloadFile as following: RainbowSdk.instance().fileStorage().downloadFile(file_descriptor_object, new IFileProxy.IDownloadFileListener() { @Override public void onDownloadSuccess(GetFileResponse result) { // Use the file_descriptor_object in parameter } @Override public void onDownloadInProgress(GetFileResponse result) { int percentDownloaded = result.getPercentDownloaded(); // If necessary, do something with that value } @Override public void onDownloadFailed(boolean notFound) { } }); Removing a file shared File shared on Rainbow can be removed at any time. When removed, the file can't be downloaded anymore by other Rainbow users. To remove a file you own, call the API removeFile. RainbowSdk.instance().fileStorage().removeFile(file_descriptor_object, new IFileProxy.IDeleteFileListener() { @Override public void onDeletionSuccess() { } @Override public void onDeletionError() { } }); Retrieve sent and received files from server After login, fetch files from server (sent and received). RainbowSdk.instance().fileStorage().fetchAllFilesSent(new IFileProxy.IRefreshListener() { @Override public void onRefreshSuccess(List<RainbowFileDescriptor> fileDescriptorList) { ... } @Override public void onRefreshFailed() { } }); RainbowSdk.instance().fileStorage().fetchAllFilesReceived(new IFileProxy.IRefreshListener() { @Override public void onRefreshSuccess(List<RainbowFileDescriptor> fileDescriptorList) { ... } @Override public void onRefreshFailed() { } }); This should be done once, before calling following methods Retrieving the files sent and received in a conversation At any time, for a dedicated conversation, you can ask for retrieving the list of files sent and received.

    "content": "DocumentationUse echo test to evaluate call qualityLTS release 2.61.0Published on 202-04-06Use the EchoTest module to evaluate Call Quality The EchoTest module provides methods to assess the quality of an audio or video call environment before a real-time conversation begins. This test evaluates the network stability and outgoing stream quality, allowing users to identify potential issues that may affect call performance. It returns the results in the form of a CallQuality object, which helps users gauge whether their device and internet connection can support high-quality calls. Rainbow conceptDescription CallQualityAn object that encapsulates the quality levels of both outgoing audio and video streams, which can be classified as Unusable, Low, Medium, Good, or Awesome. EchoTestA test that evaluates audio and video quality before a call. Preamble Before running an echo test, ensure that: Your development environment is correctly set up, following the guidelines in the Getting Started tutorial. Your application is successfully connected to the Rainbow platform, as outlined in the Connect to Rainbow tutorial. You have the necessary authentication credentials and API keys available. Once these prerequisites are in place, you're ready to start running an echo test using the Rainbow SDK for Android. Start an echo test To begin evaluating the audio and network quality of a potential call, use the startEchoTest() method. This method checks both audio and video quality and provides the results in a CallQuality object through a RainbowListener. Here’s an example of how to start an echo test: RainbowSdk().echoTest().startEchoTest(object : RainbowListener<CallQuality, Unit> { override fun onSuccess(data: CallQuality) { // Handle the results of the echo test val audioQuality = data.audioQuality val videoQuality = data.outgoingVideoQuality // Display or use the results to inform the user } override fun onError(error: RainbowError<Unit>) { // Handle the error if the test fails } }) The listener provides the test results via onSuccess, giving you access to audio and video quality metrics. The quality levels are classified into five categories: Unusable: The connection or device is not suitable for calls. Low: The connection is weak, and call quality may suffer. Medium: The connection is acceptable, but issues might arise. Good: The call should run smoothly with few interruptions. Awesome: The call quality is excellent, and no issues are expected. Stop an echo test You may want to stop the echo test before it completes, especially if the user no longer requires the results or if they wish to cancel the test for another reason. To do this, call the stopEchoTest() method. Here’s an example of stopping an active echo test: RainbowSdk().echoTest().stopEchoTest() // The echo test is canceled, and no results will be returned. This method cancels the ongoing test and ensures that no results are provided if it’s interrupted prematurely. Handle echo test results The CallQuality object returned by the startEchoTest() method contains two important properties: Audio Quality: Indicates the quality of the outgoing audio stream. Video Quality: Indicates the quality of the outgoing video stream. You can use these results to alert the user if their device or internet connection does not support a sufficient level of quality for a seamless communication experience. For example, you might prompt the user to switch to a better network if the quality is classified as Low or Unusable. Example of handling the results: override fun onSuccess(data: CallQuality) { when (data.audioQuality) { QualityLevel.UNUSABLE -> showWarning(\"Audio quality is unusable. Please check your connection.\") QualityLevel.LOW -> showWarning(\"Audio quality is low. You may experience issues during the call.\") QualityLevel.MEDIUM -> showInfo(\"Audio quality is acceptable, but could be better.\") QualityLevel.GOOD -> showInfo(\"Audio quality is good. You should have a smooth call.\") QualityLevel.AWESOME -> showInfo(\"Audio quality is awesome! You're all set.\") } // Do the same for video quality... } Conclusion The EchoTest module is an essential tool for ensuring high-quality calls by preemptively assessing both the audio and video conditions of the user’s environment. By integrating this test into your app, you can significantly improve the user experience by minimizing call disruptions and providing actionable feedback when network conditions are less than optimal. Now that you understand how to run an echo test, start improving the call quality in your app today! Happy coding!

    "content": "DocumentationUsing Class ArrayItemListLTS release 2.61.0Published on 202-04-06Using Class ArrayItemList Preamble The Rainbow SDK offers the ArrayItemList implementation which allows to easily detect when data of a list are modified. The modification is detected when: The list is cleared, An item has been added, updated or deleted, Or all items are replaced. However, when a property of an object in the list changes, the modification is not detected. For example, if you are listening to the conversations list, if a contact is updated, you are not triggered. Besides, you don't have the information of the modification but most of the time in Android, you don't need it to update an adapter. Basically, you just have to detect the modification, replace all items and then update with notifyDataSetChanged Example: manage conversations list changes You have to create an IItemListChangeListener object with a single overrided method like in the following code IItemListChangeListener m_changeListener = new IItemListChangeListener() { @Override public void dataChanged() { m_activity.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { m_adapter.updateConversations(); } }); } } Then to register to the list changes: RainbowSdk.instance().im().getAllConversations().registerChangeListener(m_changeListener); Don't forget to unregister: RainbowSdk.instance().im().getAllConversations().unregisterChangeListener(m_changeListener); And then, in the adapter: public void updateConversations() { m_conversations = RainbowSdk.instance().im().getAllConversations(); m_adapter.notifyDataSetChanged(); // Update GUI } NB: If you need to work on the list, prefer doing it on a copy with the method getCopyOfDataList() Last updated August, 18th 2017 On this pageUsing Class ArrayItemListPreambleExample: manage conversations list changesWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedRainbow CLI: Getting Started Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow CLI application ! The Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (ALE) Rainbow CLI application is a powerful command line tool allowing you to connect to the Rainbow platform and perform administrative tasks. Preamble This is a Command Line Interface for executing Rainbow commands from the shell. This Rainbow CLI application is based on the Rainbow SDK for Node.js. It's a desktop application. Many commands are available once the application is configured and connected to Rainbow. The Rainbow CLI is designed to perform a lot of Rainbow administrative tasks. This documentation will help you to use it. Prerequisites This section lists the prerequisites for using the Rainbow CLI application. Node.JS Support Node.JS must be installed on your computer. We suggest using an up-to-date LTS version of NodeJS (currently 16.17.0LTS). The Rainbow CLI application is supported only when using a Node.JS LTS version. Operating systems support OSDetails WindowsStarting Windows 7 - all versions MacOSStarting macOS 10.11 LinuxDebian, Ubuntu Note: Others Linux distributions can be used but without support. Rainbow account Your need a Rainbow account to use the Rainbow CLI application. Most of the administrative commands need an account with admin rights such as: A company (admin) account: A Rainbow account that can administrate a Rainbow company An organisation (admin) account: A Rainbow account that can adminstrate a Rainbow organisation (ie. several companies grouped together) A developer account: A Rainbow account that can administrate applications The following table sums-up how you can obtain the account depending on the platform you use. Rainbow account on Production platform StepsTasks to doRainbow CLI benefits A. Own a company1. Create a Rainbow user2. Create your own company Your Rainbow account will obtain the Company admin rightsYou can use the company commands to manage your users. B. Become developer1. Sign-in to the Rainbow for Developers portal2. Accept the terms and conditionsYour Rainbow account will obtain the Developer rightsYou can use the developer commands to create and manage your application. C. Manage several companiesIf you need more that one companies, please contact the Rainbow support team in order to obtain the Organization rights.You can use the organization commands to create companies and manage users of these companies. Rainbow account on Sandbox platform for developers StepsTasks to doRainbow CLI benefits A. Activate your Sandbox account1. Log-in to the Rainbow for Developers portal2. Create your Developer Sandbox account.You can use the company and developer commands to manage users and applications B. Manage several companiesPlease contact the Rainbow support team in order to obtain the Organization rightsYou can use the organization commands to create companies and manage users of these companies. Rainbow Application ID and Secret Key The Rainbow CLI is free of charge when using on the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers. No application ID and secret key is needed to connect the Rainbow CLI to that platform. So, you can manage for free your application and tests accounts when developing your application on the Sandbox platform. Don't forget that it is not the case for your own applications: you need an application ID for each application you're developing on the Sandbox platform for developers if you want to connect them on that platform). To connect to the Rainbow production Platform for doing the same things or much more like provisionning users, managing your company, the Rainbow CLI needs an application ID and a secret key. To get your application ID and secret key: Connect to the Rainbow for Developers portal with your Rainbow developer account, Create a new application and deploy it, Get the associated application ID and secret key Inject it to your Rainbow CLI application either using command rbw configure or command rbw set keys. Rainbow Pre-requisites summary This table sums-up the pre-requisites for working with the Rainbow CLI on the Rainbow production platform and on the Rainbow Developers Sandbox platform. Working on Production platformWorking on Developers Sandbox platform 1. Sign-in the Rainbow for Developers portal and accept the terms and conditions 2. Create an application. 3. Execute command rbw configure to select the production platform and enter the application ID and secret key.4. Execute command rbw login to connect to Rainbow Production platform5. Opt-in.

    "content": "DocumentationManaging applicationsManaging applications Preamble As a Rainbow developer, you have access to our Rainbow Developers Sandbox platform which is the playground dedicated for developers who want to start developing their applications for free. But even on that platform, your application needs to be identified (ie. by an application ID and a secret key) and authorized (ie: deployed) in order to access to Rainbow. This guide will describe the main commands you can use with your Rainbow CLI in order to manage your applications on the Rainbow Developers Sandbox platform. Rainbow Knowledge Here is some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide RainbowDetails Application IdentificationWhen connecting to Rainbow, your application need to have an identifier (application ID) and a key (secret key) to be identified. These information have to be added in your SDK or REST APIs and are sent to Rainbow and validated. Application AuthorizationOnce identified, applications need to be authorized to access to Rainbow. Only deployed applications are authorized to connect to Rainbow. On the Rainbow Developers Sandbox platform, applications created are automatically deployed in order for you to be able to develop and test your application directly. On Rainbow Production platform, applications are not_deployed when created. It's up to you to deploy it when you are ready (ie. Your application will go to in_deployment when you request a deployment and then to deployed when we authorize it.) Rainbow PUSH NotificationsOn Android and iOS devices and when your application is in background, Rainbow can send PUSH notifications to your application when for example someone sends you a instant message, invites you to a bubble, calls you, etc... In order to activate those notifications, you need to configure your application by setting a token for Android an certificates for iOS. Connecting to the Rainbow Developers Sandbox platform The first thing to do is to connect your Rainbow CLI to the Rainbow Developers Sandbox platform using the command rbw configure and rbw login. Once connected, using the command rbw whoami you can check that you have the developer role (ie. app_admin) which is mandatory to execute commands on applications. The command rbw commands lists all the available commands and particularly the commands for managing your applications (in section app_admin). Retrieving your applications Once connected you can launch the command rbw applications to list your applications and the command rbw application <id> to list the information of an application in particular. $ rbw application e17f9fa059cf11e8ae01d9b5fe1c68ca The id of the application could be retrieved by using the command rbw applications. Creating and removing applications To create a new application that will be automatically deployed, use the command rbw application create. $ rbw application create 'My new application' Once you have you application use the command rbw application <id> to get the application id (ie: id) and the secret key (ie: appSecret). You can check that your application has the property env equals to deployed which means that you can inject the application id and secret key to your SDK or REST API and you should be able to connect your application to the Rainbow Developers Sandbox platform. If you want to remove your application, just call the command rbw application delete <id>. Adding PUSH Notifications for your Android or iOS application When you are building an Android or an iOS application, you need that your users receive notifications even if their application is not used (ie. in background). In order to receive PUSH notifications from Rainbow, you need to configure your application. Android For Android, you need to configure your application with the Firebase Server Key token and the Sender ID. To find them: Open the Firebase console Select your application Go on Project settings and then on tab Cloud Messaging Copy the Server key token and the Sender ID values Once you have them, execute the command rbw application create fcmxmpp by passing the server key token and sender id such as the following $ rbw application create fcmxmpp e17f9fa059cf11e8ae01d9b5fe1c68ca AAAAenlyB01:APA91b78AEE89...ahiZA 123345 The first parameter is your application id, the second is your Firebase server key and the third is the sender id. Please note that we have no way to check that your token or sender id is valid. You can send something that is not a valid token without being refused by Rainbow.

    "content": "DocumentationManaging tests accountsManaging tests accounts Preamble If you are developing a communication or collaboration application, you need several tests users or persona in order to simulate different users. The Rainbow CLI is a super simple tool for managing these tests accounts on the Sandbox platform. This guide helps you understanding how to use the Rainbow CLI for creating accounts on the developer sandbox platform that you can use when developing your application. Rainbow Knowledge Here is some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide RainbowDetails Sandbox developer platformThis is the free platform you can use to developer your application. This platform uses different accounts than the Rainbow production platform. Rainbow production platformThis is the official Rainbow platform where real users are. You need to deploy your application to connect to this platform. Rainbow developer accountThis is a Rainbow account used on the Rainbow production platform who has signed the developer agreement and so can create applications using the Rainbow for Developers portal. Rainbow tests accountThis is a \"fake\" Rainbow account created on the Rainbow Sandbox platform when developing your application with differents users. Install As explaining in the Rainbow CLI Getting Started guide, you need to install the Rainbow CLI using the following command: Linux $ sudo npm install -g rainbow-cli Windows C:\\> npm install -g rainbow-cli Once installed, you can now sign-in and manage your account. Sign-in using your developer account You can't sign-in on the developer sandbox without your primary developer account. To obtain a new one, follow the procedure described in the Rainbow for Developers Support page. Once you obtained your developer account, you can sign-in using the following command: $ rbw login <login> <password> Discovering who you are and what you can do Once you logged in, you can check your account by using the command rbw whoami $ rbw whoami Welcome to Rainbow CLI You are logged-in as **<your login>** Your roles **user** + **admin** Your level *company_admin > user* Request List whoami ... Each time you launch a command, you can see the Rainbow CLI header that displays several information: The login used The role associated to this account: user, admin... The level associated to this role: company_admin, organization_admin... If you want to list the commands you have access depending on your level, you can launch the command rbw commands $ rbw commands Discovering your company and users To have information on your company, you can use the command rbw company $ rbw company This command produces the following output: #AttributeValue 1nameyourCompanyName 2countryFRA 3economicActivityClassificationR 4adminEmail'' ......... 26numberUsers2 To list the users in your company, use the command `rbw users`` $ rbw users This command produces the following output: #NameLoginEmailCompanyAccountRolesActiveID 1user 1user1@acompany.comaCompanyfreeuser,admintrue581b405d383b2852d37aa098 2user 2user2@acompany.comaCompanyfreeuser,admintrue581b405d383b2852d37aa099 To have more information on a specific user, use the command rbw user like in the following $ rbw user 59f0d5ca7adcbf344239dcd0 This commands produces the following output: #AttributeValue 1displayNameuser 1 2companyNameaCompany 3loginEmailuser1@acompany.com 4languageen ......... 41isInDefaultCompanyfalse You will have access to all fields and see for example if the account is locked (too many wrong password entered), the last login date... Creating new test accounts When you are developing your application, most of the time, you need several accounts to be able to test the interaction between these users (i.e. audio and video call or chat). To create a new account, use the command rbw create user $ rbw create user atestuser@acompany.com aPassword_123 aFirstname aLastname You can create as many tests accounts as you need for developing your application. Updating password and login email At any time, you can update the password or the login email of a user of your company using the commands rbw changepwd user and rbw changelogin user # Updating the password $ rbw changepwd user 59f0d5ca7adcbf344239dcd0 myNewPassword_123 # Updating the login email $ rbw changelogin user 59f0d5ca7adcbf344239dcd0 newLogin@acompany.com Removing a test account If you need to remove a test account, you have to call the command rbw delete user $ rbw delete user 59f0d5ca7adcbf344239dcd0 Now, you have the minimum knowledge for using the rainbow CLI and create the tests accounts you need for your application. The Rainbow CLI offers many other commands you can play with...

    "content": "DocumentationMass-provisioningMass provisioning Preamble Creating lot of Rainbow account manually can be very boring. The Rainbow CLI can be use to quickly import a long list of users to Rainbow or to associate devices to users just by using some commands. This guide describes the different commands to use to do mass provisioning of users and devices. Rainbow Knowledge Here is some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide RainbowDetails Mass-proThis is the action of importing to Rainbow a list of users to provision from an input file (ie: generally a CSV file). CSV templateTo ease the provisionning, you can download a template file that is in fact a sample of file that can be importing. In this sample, you will have an example of how to add a new user, how to remove it, etc... Getting the mass-provisioning template The first thing to do is to retrieve a CSV template file from Rainbow. This file is a helper that gives you the syntax to use. Two types of template exists in Rainbow: user template: Use this template if you want to import user in Rainbow device template: Use this template if you want to associate user to device In order to retrieve the user template, use the following command: $ rbw masspro template user If you want to use the device template, just replace the previous command by this one: $ rbw masspro template device By default these commands download the template and save it to the file template.csv in the current directory. If a file already exists, it will be replaced. If you want to download the template and save it into a specific file, adapt the command such as the following: $ rbw masspro template user users.csv Understanding the template file Once you have downloaded your mass-provisioning template, you are readuy to modify it. Open the file with your preferred editor. Here is the content of the template for users: __action__;loginEmail;password;title;firstName;lastName;nickName;businessPhone0;mobilePhone0;email0;jobTitle;country;language;timezone create;alice.johns@company.com;AzertY10*;Mrs;Alice;Johns;alicej;49123456789;4998765432;alice.johns@company.com;Logistic;DEU;de-DE;Europe/Berlin update;eric.lasalle@company.com;;;;;;;;;Tech Support;;; delete;carol.jenkins@company.com;;;;;;;;;;;; % Use this template to create/modify/remove members of a company % % Field ;Optionality ;Format ;Description % % __action__ ;Mandatory ;<create|update|delete> ;Action to perform % loginEmail ;Mandatory ;email address ;Main or professional email used as login % password ;Optional ;text (>= 8 chars with 1 capital+1 number+1 special char) ;(e.g. This1Pwd!) % title ;Optional ;text ;(e.g. Mr, Mrs, Dr, ...) % firstName ;Optional ;text % lastName ;Optional ;text % nickName ;Optional ;text % businessPhone0 ;Optional ;E.164 number ;DDI phone number (e.g. +33123456789) % mobilePhone0 ;Optional ;E.164 number ;Mobile phone number (e.g. +33601234567) % email0 ;Optional ;email address ;Personal email % jobTitle ;Optional ;text % country ;Optional ;ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 ;(e.g. FRA) % language ;Optional ;ISO 639-1 (en) / with ISO 31661 alpha-2 (en-US) % timezone ;Optional ;IANA tz database (Europe/Paris) The first line describes the different columns or attributes to fill. __action__;loginEmail;password;title;firstName;lastName;nickName;businessPhone0;mobilePhone0;email0;jobTitle;country;language;timezone The first attribute is always the action to do that can be: create: This line is a new user to import in Rainbow update: This line will update an existing user in Rainbow delete: This line will remove an existing user in Rainbow Then, the other attributes represent the information of the contact. Depending on the action to do, there is more or less information, but the nomber of attributes should be always the same, so you have to add separator event if there is no more valuable information. Then the template contains some example: create;alice.johns@company.com;AzertY10*;Mrs;Alice;Johns;alicej;49123456789;4998765432;alice.johns@company.com;Logistic;DEU;de-DE;Europe/Berlin update;eric.lasalle@company.com;;;;;;;;;Tech Support;;; delete;carol.jenkins@company.com;;;;;;;;;;;; And finally, there is a description of each attributes to fill. Checking your CSV file Once you have done your modifications. Save your file and launch the following command that will check if your file is syntaxically correct or not. $ rbw masspro check users.csv Replace the name users.csv by the name of your file. If the file is correct, this command will return the number of actions that will be done. In case of errors in the file, an error message is displayed to help you understanding what's wrong. Importing your CSV file If there is no error in the file, you can upload it and so import the users (or associate the device to the users). $ rbw masspro import users.csv This command uploads the content of the file on Rainbow and so imports the users or associates them to a device (depending on your template). Once executed, this co"

    "content": "DocumentationConnecting to RainbowLTS release 2.13.0Published on 2025-03-07Connecting to Rainbow This tutorial details how you connect to Rainbow and more generally how you deal with the authentication and the connection parts. These steps are mandatories in order to have access to services such as voice and video calls, chat or files sharing, etc... Rainbow conceptDetails Sandbox platform for developersThis Rainbow platform is dedicated to developers. The Sandbox platform for developers is not connected to the Production platform and let developers be familiar with our APIs and SDKs. This platform uses different users accounts and application Id. Some limitations can occur regarding the preformance and availability. Production platformThis Rainbow platform is the official one with all Rainbow services and infrastructures enabling a high availability and accessibility all over the world.For using it, you need to create and deploy an application.This is the platform you use when connecting with our Rainbow applications. Preamble The Rainbow SDK for iOS is a library we made in order to allow any iOS applications to use Rainbow services such as chat, voice and video calls, conferences, notifications and much more... This SDK connects to Rainbow using 2 different ways: The first is by sending HTTP REST requests in order to invoke services such as creating a bubbles, inviting a users, etc... A lot of theses API allow to manage your data on Rainbow. The second is by having a persistant connection to Rainbow using a Websocket when the application is active and by having a notification channel (PUSH) when the application is in background. This connection is mandatory in order to receive any real-time events coming from Rainbow such as an incomign chat message, an incoming call, etc... So, if you don't configure the Push notifications service by following our guide Push notifications, you will not be able to receive incoming notifications when your application will be inactive. This tutorial assumes that you followed the tutorial Hello world and that you have an active Rainbow application. Sign-in to Rainbow This tutorial will start by explaining how to connect on the Rainbow Production platform using your Rainbow account and later in that guide, you will see how to connect to the Rainbow Sandbox Platform for Developers. You can sign-in to Rainbow using your username (loginEmail) and your password. For that, you need to call the setUsername method with your credentials information followed by the connect method. swift objective C func signin(loginEmail: String, password: String) { ServicesManager.sharedInstance().loginManager.setUsername(loginEmail, andPassword: password) ServicesManager.sharedInstance().loginManager.connect() } - (void) signin:(NSString*)loginEmail andPassword:(NSString*)password { [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].loginManager setUsername:loginEmail andPassword:password]; [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].loginManager connect]; } Sign-in to Rainbow using a token A best practice is to do this Rainbow authentication from your backend side and not from your iOS application side. By getting a token from your backend that is then used by your application will better secure this authentication step. By doing the Rainbow authentication from your server, you will avoid the following security concerns: Compromising the user credentials: Managing the authentication on client side will let your application have access to the username and password of the user. Compromising your application key secret: Managing the authentication on client side requires the application secret. So if your application is not secure enough, someone can steal your secret key. More information can be found by reading the tutorial Rainbow users authentication So, once received the token from your server, instead of calling the 2 previous methods, just call the method connectWithToken with that token like in the following. swift objective C func signinWithToken(token: String) { ServicesManager.sharedInstance().loginManager.connect(withToken: token) } - (void) signinWithToken:(NSString*)token { [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].loginManager connectWithToken:token]; } Listen to authentication events In order to know if the authentication has succeeded, you need to listen to some Rainbow events. Here is the list of events you need listen to: EventsDescription kLoginManagerDidLoginSucceededFired when the the user is connected to Rainbow and authentified kLoginManagerDidFailedToAuthenticateFired when there is an issue during the authentication step.Mainly due to a bad login or password kLoginManagerDidReconnectFired when a previous Rainbow session has been reused successfully. In that case the user is connected and authentifed and all the existing data received in the previous session is reoloaded locally from the cache. kLoginManagerTryToReconnectFired after 5s if the reconnection has not been reestablished.If the reconnection takes time"

When a file is shared in a conversation (received or sent), an instance of this file is created and stored in a file array (files property of the fileSharingService). Knowing their rainbowIDit is possible to get the associated file instance. Notifications are fired each time a file is created (by me or by others if I can view it) : kFileSharingServiceDidCreateFile modified (including thumbnail creation) : kFileSharingServiceDidUpdateFile deleted (removed by me or removed from the viewers) : kFileSharingServiceDidRemoveFile When a file is deleted, the file instance is still available in the files porperty array, but the isDeleted property is true. Receive files File data File instances are created when the file descriptor is retrieved from the server. At this time, the file data are not available in the SDK. The file data have to be explicitely requested via a download request and are then stored in cache. Further download requests will access the cached data and won't download them from the server anymore, until the cache is removed. let myFile = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().fileSharingService.getFileByRainbowID(fileId)) ServicesManager.sharedInstance().fileSharingService.downloadData(for: myFile) { file, error in if let error = error as? NSError { // Error management ... } if let data = file.data { ... } } Send files To send a file, create first a temporary file with the file data. Temporary files are not stored in the files property of the fileSharingService. var filesToCreate = [File]() guard let file = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().fileSharingService.createTemporaryFile( withFileName: \"myFileName\", andData: data, andURL: nil) else { // Error management return } filesToCreate.append(file) ServicesManager.sharedInstance().fileSharingService.uploadFiles(toPersonalStorage: filesToCreate) { errorsDict, error in if let errorsDict = errorsDict { // Error management } ... } Thumbnails When files are uploaded on the rainbow server, a thumbnail is generated. The SDK is informed and downloads the thumbnail. A notification kFileSharingServiceDidUpdateFile is fired once the thumbnail image is available in the file.thumbnailproperty. The file.thumbnailproperty will always provide an image, even if the thumbnail is not available. In this case, an icon corresponding to the file type is returned.

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedLTS release 2.12.0Published on 2024-07-23Rainbow SDK for iOS: Getting Started Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow Software Development Kit (SDK) for iOS! The Rainbow SDK for iOS is a Objective-C library that works on iPhone and iPad devices. Its powerful APIs enable you to create the best iOS applications using Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow. Getting started with the Rainbow SDK for iOS could not be easier. By importing the library to your existing iOS project, you have access to the services of Rainbow that let you add voice and video, files sharing, group chat and much more to your application. Note: The Rainbow SDK for iOS also embeds the WebRTC audio/video stack from Google. Rainbow knowledge Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide. Rainbow conceptDetails RainbowAlcatel-Lucent Rainbow™ is a cloud-based, enterprise-grade, Unified Communication as a Service (UCaaS) and Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS) that connects people, systems and things. EventsEvents are asynchronous messages or notifications that come from Rainbow when something related to your data happens. By listening to theses events, your application will be able to react and inform the user of these changes. MethodsMethods are all the SDK functions your application can call to enable Rainbow services such as initiating a WebRTC call, sending a file, etc. Methods of the SDK can be synchronous or asynchronous but most of the case, you will have to rely on events to receive the changes. Preamble Our Rainbow SDK for iOS is an Objective-C library dedicated for iPhone and iPad devices for building collaborative applications with chat, group-chat, voice and video calls, voice and video conferences, file sharing, notifications and much more... Adding this library to your existing project will give you super-powers to build applications that will change the life of your users. It will never has been so easy to give them the possibility to chat, call and access important information in real time using their iPhone and iPad. Take time to read this guide to understand the basics and the prerequisites and then code what you ever dreamed! Prerequisites iOS The Rainbow SDK for iOS supports older versions of iOS up to : Pre-requisitesVersion supported iOS>= 15.0 Note: Even if we still support older versions of Apple iOS, we recommend to stay closer to Apple guidelines and supported versions. Platforms supported PlatformsSupported iPhone (iOS)YES iPad (iOS)YES TV (tvOS)NO Watch (watchOS)NO Mac (macOS)NO Note: Contact us if you have projets that target not currently supported platforms. Language Compatibility Even if the Rainbow SDK for iOS is an Objective-C library, you can develop your application using Objective-C or Swift. Have a look to our Hello World guide that will describe how to develop an Hello World application using Objective-C or Swift. Additionnal sample in Objective-C or Swift can be found on our Github repositories for iOS. Note: As Swift is not our primary target language, don't hesitate to report any issues on the forum. It will help us moving to a full Swift support. Rainbow developer account and application You need a Rainbow developer account and a Rainbow application in order to use the Rainbow SDK for iOS. Connect to the Rainbow for developers to sign-up for a Rainbow developer account and for creating and managing your Rainbow applications. What is the Rainbow SDK for iOS? The Rainbow SDK for iOS is a library you have to use to connect and access Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow. This library gives you access to all Rainbow services such as calling someone in voice and video, chatting, sharing a file, etc... In fact, this library will manage for you all the complicated part needed to synchronize your data with Rainbow and for sending and receiving information, files, voice and video from your recipients. Once importing to your project, you will have access to a ServicesManager object that represents the Rainbow root entry to the library. Using it, you will be able to access to your data and send requests to Rainbow and so to other Rainbow users by calling Rainbow methods. This library is divided in services that let you access to a set of methods that communicate with Rainbow. Additionnaly, you will have to use the NotificationCenter to subscribe to Rainbow events to be notified of asynchronous things such as an incoming chat message or an incoming voice call.

This Hello World tutorial will help you walking through the basic steps to launch your first application that uses the Rainbow SDK for iOS. If you wonder how to set up the development environment and basic application structure, you are in the right place. If you have already built an app, this article will reiterate through the fundamental app structure in case you got lost on the way. At the end of this tutorial you will have a working application that could be considered as a starting point for developing an app using the Rainbow SDK for iOS. You will also get the basic notion of the key Rainbow SDK for iOS concepts. The goal is to keep it simple, therefore we will show you how to do using Objective-C and Swift languages when needed. Set up your development environement Before you start using Rainbow SDK for iOS, you need to make sure you have installed the required software tools. Apple Xcode Make sure to have installed the current Apple Xcode development environment on your Mac. An Apple developer ID and certificate will be mandatory later for deploying your application on the Apple Store, but this part is outside of our guides. Please read the Apple Developer documentation if needed. Carthage Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager, flexible and pretty easy to use. The minimum Carthage version required is 0.38.0. You can install Carthage in two different ways : Download and install the latest .pkg installer here With Homebrew using the following command : $ brew update $ brew install carthage Cocoapods Cocoapods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. The minimum Cocoapods version required is 1.10.0. You also can install Cocoapods in two different ways : Using a Ruby gem as described here With Homebrew using the following command : $ brew update $ brew install cocoapods Create your iOS application Launch Xcode and then click on Create a new Xcode project The first thing to do is to choose a template for your application. As mentioned before, the project is goind to use a basic structure and will be very simple. Select the iOS tab panel, select the App and then click on the Next button. Enter the name Hello World for your application in the Product Name field and then select the Language you want to use in your application. Select Swift for a writing your application using the Swift language or Objective-C. Then click on the Next button. Finally, select a directory where the source code of your application will be located and click on the Create button. As your application is now created, the next step is to import the Rainbow SDK for iOS. Import the Rainbow SDK for iOS The Rainbow SDK for iOS is composed of two libraries: Rainbow.xcframework: The Rainbow SDK itself containing all the methods and logics to connect to Rainbow and invoke Rainbow services WebRTC.xcframework : The Google WebRTC stack needed for managing Voice and Video calls and conferences You have 4 options for adding the Rainbow SDK for iOS to your project: using Swift Package Manager, Carthage, Cocoapods or manually. Using Swift Package Manager (SPM) Open \"Package Dependencies\" in your Xcode project and add the following dependencies : \"https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-iOS-SDK.git\" \"https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-iOS-WebRTC.git\" \"https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git\" \"https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift.git\" Using Carthage When using Carthage, the first thing to do is to create a Cartfile file into your project $ cd ~/Hello\\ World/Hello\\ World $ touch Cartfile Note: You have to be in the Hello World sub directory Open the Cartfile with your favorite text editor and add the following lines # Rainbow SDK binary framework binary \"https://sdk.openrainbow.io/ios/carthage/RainbowSDK.json\" == 2.13.0 Note: Please notice the Rainbow SDK for iOS version number at the end. Please have a look to your Changelog guide to see the changes for each version of the SDK. Then you need to download both prebuild frameworks into your Xcode project by launching the Carthage update command : $ carthage update --use-xcframeworks Once downloaded, the Rainbow SDK XCFrameworks will be located at the root of Build folder. The next step is to add the 2 libraries downloaded into your embedded binaries : Open your application Targets and go to General settings, in the Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content section, click the + button then the Add other button and select each framework from the ~/Hello World/Hello World/Carthage/Build/iOS/ like in the following video and click on Select. Finally select the Create groups option and click on Finish. Using Cocoapods If you are using Cocoapods, navigate to your project root directory and type the command below to create your Podfile : $ pod init Open the Podfile and add the RainbowSDK pod : platform :ios, '11.0' use_frameworks! target 'MyApp' do pod 'RainbowSDK' end Save the P"

It could also deliver images, voice messages, geographic maps and allows to share any files. The sample application Rainbow-iOS-SDK-Sample-Swift provide a reference code covering instant messaging using the Rainbow SDK. Retrieving Conversations Retrieving all conversations concerning the connected user is done as follow: swift let conversations = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().conversationsManagerService.conversations This will return a list of all conversations you have participated in. To listen for any changes in conversations you can use the kConversationsManagerDidUpdateConversation notification: swift NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(didUpdateConversation(_:)), name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue:kConversationsManagerDidUpdateConversation), object: nil) swift @objc func didUpdateConversation(_ notification: Notification) { if let updatedConversation = notification.object as? Conversation { // do some thing with this updatedConversation ... } } Favorite Conversations Conversations with other users, bots or in rooms could be marked as favorites so the UI part of the application could highlight them and give easy access to them. The favorites are handled by the FavoritesManager class in the SDK. Listening and responding to incoming messages Listening to incoming messages Listening to instant messages coming from other users is very easy. You just have to use the kConversationsManagerDidReceiveNewMessageForConversation event: swift NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(didReceiveNewMessage(_:)), name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue:kConversationsManagerDidReceiveNewMessageForConversation), object: nil) swift @objc func didReceiveNewMessage(_ notification: Notification) { if let conversation = notification.object as? Conversation { //do something with **recivedConversation** object ... } } Sending a new message You can send a new message to a conversation as follow, swift ServicesManager.sharedInstance().conversationsManagerService.sendTextMessage(\"Message to send\", conversation: conversation) { message, error in // do something with **message** ... } Sending a new message with a priority You may use a MessagePriority when sending a message. Except for the MessagePriority.high priority which need the Critical Alerts Entitlement from Apple, using the .default, .low or .middle priority doesn't change the delivery of the message, this is the client app responsability to emphasis higher priority messages using the priority property of the Message class. swift let conversation : Conversation = ... let priority : MessagePriority = .middle // .default | .low | .middle | .high ServicesManager.sharedInstance().conversationsManagerService.sendTextMessage(\"Urgent message\", files: nil, mentions: nil, priority: .middle, repliedMessage: nil, conversation: conversation) { message, error in // do something with **message** ... } Mark new messages as read Mark all messages as read If you want to mark all messages as read for a conversation, you must use markAllMessagesAsReadForConversation method as follow: swift ServicesManager.sharedInstance().conversationsManagerService.markAllMessagesAsRead(for: conversation) Notes: - The request is delayed and performed when the initial fetch of the conversation is done (to initialize the counter) - The request is not sent if the number of unread messages is equal to 0 Mark all new received message as read in the open conversation For the currently displayed conversation in the application, you must set the automaticallySendMarkAsReadNewMessage parameter for the Conversation object to true. For example, you may set it to true in the viewWillAppear method and false in the viewWillDisappear method. Listening to receipts Receipts allow to know if the message has been successfully delivered to your recipient. Here are the possible delivery states: message StatevalueMeaning MessageDeliveryState.sent0The message state is sent to server MessageDeliveryState.delivered1The message state is Delevered MessageDeliveryState.received2The message state is Received MessageDeliveryState.read3The message state is Read MessageDeliveryState.failed4The message state is Failed to send You Can check paramerter state for each message as follow, swift let message = ... // message to check state NSLog(\"\\(message.state)\") Getting the conversation history You can retrieve the message history of a conversation with the help of a MessagesBrowser instance from the ConversationsManagerService: swift // pageSize The maximum number of retrieved messages, for example 20. // preload retrieve imediately from the local cache let messagesBrowser = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().conversationsManagerService.messagesBrowser(for: conversation, withPageSize:20, preloadMessages: true) messagesBrowser?"

Users that subscribe to a channel could react to the posts with Reactions (like, don't like, ...). There are 2 kind (mode) of channels, providing different visibility: Channel modeDescription PublicAll users of the company can search, consult, subscribe and unsubscribe this channel. ClosedOnly an Owner can add users to the channel. Invitation is forced and users can't unsubscribe. More details in the Creating channels section. In a channel, an user has a role that defines his rights. More details in the Managing users in channels section. Each channel keep upto aChannel.max_items persistent items (30 by default), when this limit is reached the older items are retracted. A channel item has several fields: Channel item Title Body URL A list of images A list of attachments Youtube video The Body of the item could have one of these content types: Basic: the body is in UTF-8 text. HTML: the body can contains HTML tags. Markdown: the body can contains markdown tags. Data: the body content could be anything. Accessing the user subscribed channels Once connected, you can browse the channels you are involved in using the channels property of the ChannelsService singleton object. The channels property is a read-only array that is maintained by the SDK: swift objective C let channels = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().channelsService.channels NSArray *channels = [ServicesManager sharedInstance].channelsService.channels; The latest published channels items are cached by the ChannelsService in the channelsItems read-only array : swift objective C let channelsItems = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().channelsService.channelsItems NSArray *channelsItems = [ServicesManager sharedInstance].channelsService.channelsItems; There is also a helper method to get a channel by his channelId: swift objective C let channel = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().channelsService.getChannel(channelId) Channel *channel = [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].channelsService getChannel: channelId]; You may have to filter the items for a channel using the channelId property of the items and compare it to the channel.id property of the given channel : swift objective C var itemsInChannel : [ChannelItem] = [] ... itemsInChannel.removeAll() for item in ServicesManager.sharedInstance().channelsService.channelsItems { if item.channelId == channel?.id { itemsInChannel.append(item) } } @property (nonatomic, strong) NSMutableArray<ChannelItem *> *itemsInChannel; ...

They are based on chat rooms. The sample application RainbowiOSSDKSwift has been extended to also demonstrate audio/video WebRTC room conferences. You should refer to the code in the TabBarController, EditRoomViewController and ConferenceViewController classes. It's recommended to allow the usage of CallKit in your app, which needs the following background modes in Info.plist: <key>UIBackgroundModes</key> <array> <string>audio</string> <string>voip</string> </array> Conference participants The ConferenceParticipant class is the generic class representing all the kind of users that could connect to a conference. There exist several subclasses of ConferenceParticipant: RoomConfParticipant this class represent participants that could interact with the other participant using WebRTC audio, video and screen sharing. The roomParticipant property give access to the Participant object of this conference participant which describe the user as a member of the room where the conference take place. WebinarConfParticipant is a subclass of RoomConfParticipant representing participant in a webinar which is a specialized kind of conference. PhoneConfParticipant this class represent participants using a classical phone to join the conference. HGPhoneConfParticipant is a specialized class of PhoneConfParticipant which represent participant in a phone hunting group. The ConferenceParticipant method getContact return the associated Contactobject for a participant if he is known. ####Conference participant roles A conference participant could be a member of the room where the conference is started or a invited guest, he could have one of the following ParticipantRole roles: ParticipantRoleDescription .membera attendee member of the room without conference administration rights .moderatora attendee member of the room with conference administration rights .guesta invited guest in the conference The member of the room who started the conference has the .moderator role, this could be the owner of the room or a delegate. Start or join a conference To start a conference, the user must be the owner of the room or a delegate in that room, otherwise other room members could join a already started conference. swift // The room where the conference will take place let room : Room = ... // if true, the user video will be activated by default when joining a already // started conference let forceLocalVideo : Bool = ... // Check if the user has the rights to start a conference in this room if room.isAbleToStartConference() { // Start the conference or join it if it's already started ServicesManager.sharedInstance().conferencesManagerService.startOrJoin(room, forceLocalVideo: forceLocalVideo) { error in if let error = error as? NSError { // Handle the error ... } else { // The conference is started and joined ... } } } There are also several other methods allowing to set differents options at start and/or join conference time: swift /** * Join a conference * You can also start the conference if needed * * @param room the room to join (with the correct conference) * @param start start the conference before joining * @param completionHandler the block called at the completion */ func join(room: Room, start: Bool, completionHandler:ConferenceManagerErrorBlock?) /** * Join a started conference * You can force the local video or the mute to be activated at start * * @param room the room to join (with the correct conference) * @param forceLocalVideo if true, the user video will be activated by default * @param forceMuted if true, the user will be muted (otherwise it will follow the muteUponEntry property) * @param completionHandler the block called at the completion */ func join(room: Room, forceLocalVideo: Bool, forceMuted: Bool, completionHandler: ConferenceManagerErrorBlock?)

If a participant is not logged he will receive un VoIP push notification (The app should be setup to receive push notifications), otherwise if he's actually logged and the app could use Apple CallKit, a standard call notification is shown along a ringing tone allowing the user to take or reject the call. If the user take the conference call a join conference will be done automatically. To be notified about a incoming conference call the app may use the following code in a UIViewController that is always loaded in the application, like a instance of a subclass of UITabBarController (see the TabBar"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging contactsLTS release 2.13.0Published on 2025-03-07Contacts Contacts in Rainbow are the master piece of your application. Understanding how contacts are managed is the key to build a great application. In this tutorial, you will learn all the methods and events for inviting and interacting with your contacts as well as for accessing to their vcard or profile. By reading this tutorial, you will be able To retrieve your network To retrieve vcard information of a contact To invite new contacts to your network To interact with a contact Rainbow knowledge Here are some important definitions. Rainbow conceptDetails A Rainbow userA Rainbow user is a user who has a Rainbow account and who can connect to Rainbow. Depending on his visibility, you can find him and so interact with him. When interacting with a Rainbow user, you only have access to his public profile. An invitationA invitation is a request sent to a Rainbow user (or received from a Rainbow user) in order to share with him the availability of each (ie: available, busy on the phone, away, not connected...).Invitations are auto-accepted when your recipient is in the same company as you. My networkThis is the list of contacts who have accepted your invitations and those you have accepted their invitations. With these contacts, you are sharing mutually your availability (aka presence): They see your availability, you see their availability.You need to invite a Rainbow user to be part of your network. We say that these contacts are in your network. A contactA contact is a Rainbow user who is part of your network This is important to understand that inviting Rainbow users to your network will give you not only more information about these users but more information on how to interact with them too. Knowing the availability of a user (presence), knowing how he is connected (mobile, desktop) will let you build a more smoothly application. Note: More Rainbow REST APIs exist that can be used to automatically add some Rainbow users to the network of an other users, such as for example giving to a user a pre-defined list of people he can call if needed. So once connected, this list of users will appears in his application. These APIs are document in the Rainbow for developers: Admin APIs and need a Rainbow admin account to be used. Coding using Swift This tutorial uses the Swift language. Objective-C code will not be provided, if needed please ask for having it in our Rainbow for developers Forum Retrieving your network So, when starting your application, the first thing you would perhaps do is to display the list of contacts of your network. Assuming that you want to do that, you need to wait for the event kContactsManagerServiceDidEndPopulatingMyNetwork before being able to display these contacts. The following code will show you how to retrieve your network's contacts. // somewhere in your code var _network = Array<Contact> // Handle the notification NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(didReceiveNetworkContacts(notification:)), name: NSNotification.Name(kContactsManagerServiceDidEndPopulatingMyNetwork), object: nil) // Delegate @objc private func didReceiveNetworkContacts(notification: NSNotification) { if !Thread.isMainThread { DispatchQueue.main.async { self.didReceiveNetworkContacts(notification: notification) } return } _network = filter(contacts: ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.contactsManagerService.myNetworkContacts ?? []) } func filter(contacts: Array<Contact>) -> Array<Contact> { return contacts.filter { (contact) -> Bool in return isContactPartOfTheNetwork(contact: contact) } } func isContactPartOfTheNetwork(contact:Contact) -> Bool { guard let _:String = contact.rainbowID else { // Check that contact object is well formed return false } if contact.rainbowID == ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.myUser.contact.rainbowID { // Check that this is not the connected user return false } if(contact.isBot) { // Put to true if you want to keep bots return false } // Check that the user is really in the roster return contact.isInRoster } Note: You can notice that if you just call the property contactsManagerService.myNetworkContacts you could have more contacts than expected. So a best practice is to filter that list to be sure to keep only the contacts you need. For example, when an invitation has been seen to a contact, this contact is part of that list, but the property isInRoster is still equal to false. Searching for users If you want to interact with Rainbow users who are not part of your network, you need to initiate a search request. For that, you have to call the method searchRemoteContacts such as in the following code func search(pattern: String) { ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.contactsManagerService!.searchRemoteContacts(withPattern: pattern, advancedMode: true, limitPerCategory: 20, rainbowUsersOnly: true, search: SearchRemoteContactsMode.all, withCompletionHandler: { (text, contacts) in // Do som"

The Favorite class encapsulate the favorite objects, the favoriteObject is a reference to the encapsulated object (Contact or Room) Favorite objects are managed by the FavoritesManager. Retrieving the list of favorites The FavoritesManager global property -(NSArray<FavoriteProtocol>*) favorites keep a local list of the connected user's favorite list. This list is fetched from the server when the user connects, the kFavoritesDidLoadFromServer notification is sent when the favorite list is updated from the server, and kFavoritesDidLoadFromCache notification is sent when the favorite list is update from the cache. It is also possible to retrieve the favorites from the server at any time with the getAllFavorites(completionHandler:) method, that will update the local favorites array: swift ServicesManager.sharedInstance().favoritesManager.getAllFavorites { error in if let error = error as? NSError { // handle the error ... } } Retrieve a favorite by its id You are able to get a favorite using its id with the getFavoriteByObjectId method: swift let objectID:String = \"...\" if let favorite = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().favoritesManager.getFavoriteByObjectId(objectID) { ... } Create a favorite Create a favorite and add it at the last position A favorite can be created and added at last position with the createFavorite(_, completionHandler:) method: swift // The room or the contact to add to the favorite list let roomOrContact = ... ServicesManager.sharedInstance().favoritesManager.createFavorite(roomOrContact) { error in if let error = error as? NSError { // handle the error ... } } Create a favorite and insert it at the requested position A favorite can be create and inserted at a specific position with the createFavorite(_, atPosition:, completionHandler:) method: swift // The room or the contact to add to the favorite list let roomOrContact = ... // The favorite position in the list let position:UInt = ... ServicesManager.sharedInstance().favoritesManager.createFavorite(roomOrContact, atPosition: position) { error in if let error = error as?

ServicesManager.sharedInstance().favoritesManager.updateFavorite(roomOrContact, toPosition: position) { error in if let error = error as? NSError { // handle the error ... } } Delete a favorite You can delete a favorite by calling the deleteFavorite(_, completionHandler:) method: swift // The room or the contact to remove in the favorite list let roomOrContact = ... ServicesManager.sharedInstance().favoritesManager.deleteFavorite(roomOrContact) { error in if let error = error as? NSError { // handle the error ... } } Check if a favorite is in the list You can check if a favorite is in the list by calling the is(inFavorites:) method: swift // The room or the contact to test let roomOrContact = ... if ServicesManager.sharedInstance().favoritesManager.is(inFavorites: roomOrContact) { ... } Listening to favorites list changes In order to catch modification of the favorites, you have to register listeners to the following events: Event constantDescription kFavoritesDidLoadFromServerConstant for favorite fetched from server notification kFavoritesDidLoadFromCacheConstant for favorite loaded from cache notification kFavoritesDidCreateConstant for favorite create notifications kFavoritesDidUpdateConstant for favorite update notifications kFavoritesDidDeleteConstant for favorite delete notifications On this pageManaging favoritesPreambleRetrieving the list of favoritesRetrieve a favorite by its idCreate a favoriteCreate a favorite and add it at the last positionCreate a favorite and insert it at the requested positionUpdate the favorite's positionDelete a favoriteCheck if a favorite is in the listListening to favorites list changesWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging personal profileLTS release 2.12.0Published on 2024-07-23Managing personal profile In this tutorial, you will learn how to retrieve or update your Rainbow personal profile information. By reading this tutorial, you will be able To retrieve your Rainbow personal information such as your name, firstname, title, company name, avatar, etc... To edit your firstname, lastname or any others information and update your avatar To change your presence status So, take time to read this tutorial to understand how to manage these information. Accessing your personal profile Using the SDK for iOS, the application have access to the Rainbow personal profile of the connected user by using the property contact of the interface myUser. let personalProfile:Contact? = ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.myUser.contact Be carefull when accessing this information, the contact property is an Optional and is only set either when the user is connected to Rainbow or if the SDK has stored a previous session used. In other cases, contact will be equal to nil. From the property contact, you have access to all information of the personal profile of the connected user including the following properties: fullname: The is the concatenation of the connected user firstName and lastName companyName: This represents the Rainbow company of the user. photoData: this property contains the avatar of the user. It could be nil if the connected user has never set an avatar. presence : This information represents the availability of the connected user which means the way how other users will see him (ie: online, busy, away...) rainbowId: The Rainbow unique identifier of the connected user jid: Secondary Rainbow identifier used for real time services such as instant messages, voice and video call, etc... ...: There is a lot of other information contained into the user profile: emailAddresses, addresses, phoneNumbers, etc... For example, the following code displays the user profile when connected to Rainbow func updateConnectedUser() { // Try to access the user information guard let userContact = ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.myUser.contact, let name = userContact.fullName, let companyName = userContact.companyName else { resetUserInformation() return } let avatar = userContact.photoData ?? Data() updateUserInformation(name: name, nameOfCompany: companyName, avatar: avatar) } func updateUserInformation(name: String = \"\", nameOfCompany: String = \"\", avatar: Data = Data()) { // Uddate some labels userFullname.text = name companyName.text = nameOfCompany // Update an ImageView containing the user avatar userPhoto.image = UIImage(data: avatar) } func resetUserInformation() { // Display empty fields when no user updateUserInformation() } @objc func didLogin(notification: NSNotification) { DispatchQueue.main.async { self.updateConnectedUser() } } Displaying the presence status The presence status can be accessed from the property ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.myUser.contact.presence. There are several status of presence in Rainbow. These presence status represent several things that help and give to other users two main informations, which are Is the user available or not ? How to reach him ? A complete list of these status can be found in that guide. This guide also explains how users can interact with you depending on this status. If you want to display this status as a String, you can use the function Presence.string() such as in the following code var presence = Presence.string(forContactPresence: userContact.presence) You will received value such as Online, Away, Do not disturb and Invisible. Additionnaly to that, you can know if the user is connected using a mobile application only using the property isConnectedWithMobile if userContact.isConnectedWithMobile { // Do something with that information } If the user is connected with a desktop application that embeds a SDK too, he will be seen as Online, the property isConnectedWithMobile is set to false. Note: You have only access to the presence of users of your network. Handling personal profile change Each time you change something in your personal profile, you can receive a notification that confirms this change in order to update your application. so for example, when you change your avatar photo, your will receive this event. It will be the same when your manually change your presence or when your presence change due to an incoming call, etc... To listen to that event, you have to use the NotificationsCenter and to observe the event kContactsManagerServiceDidUpdateMyContact. Here is the code to add to the previous example in order to call the function updateConnectedUser() each time an update is done in your profile in order to refresh your application UI. @objc func didUpdateConnectedUserInformation(notification: NSNotification) { DispatchQueue.main.async { self.updateConnectedUser() } } override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) { super.viewWillAppear(animated) // Add"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging roomsLTS release 2.13.0Published on 2025-03-07Managing rooms This guide explains how to manage rooms and to discuss within them. The full API is documented in the RoomsService documentation. Creation, archiving and deletion This first part of the guide will explain how to create, archive and delete a room. Create a new room To create a new room, you can use the method createRoom:options:completionHandler:: swift objective C ServicesManager.sharedInstance().roomsService.createRoom(\"Name of the room\", withTopic: \"Topic of the room\", options: [:]) { room, error in if let error = error as? NSError { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process } } [ServicesManager.sharedInstance.roomsService createRoom:@\"Name of the room\" withTopic:@\"Topic of the room\" options:nil completionHandler: ^(Room *room, NSError *error){ if (error) { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process, for example add participants in the room } }]; To create a auto accept invitation room, which means all invitations to add users in the room will be auto accepted, you should use the autoAccepted boolean option in the options dictionary swift objective C ServicesManager.sharedInstance().roomsService.createRoom(\"Name of the room\", withTopic: \"Topic of the room\", options: [\"autoAccepted\" : true]) { room, error in if let error = error as? NSError { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process } } [ServicesManager.sharedInstance.roomsService createRoom:@\"Name of the room\" withTopic:@\"Topic of the room\" options: @{@\"autoAccepted\" : @YES} completionHandler: ^(Room *room, NSError *error){ if (error) { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process, for example add participants in the room } }]; There are more available options, you may look RoomsService documentation to discover them all. Archive a room To archive a room, you can use the method archiveRoom as following: swift objective C let roomToBeArchived = ... ServicesManager.sharedInstance().roomsService.archiveRoom(room) { error in if let error = error as? NSError { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process } }) Room *roomToBeArchived = ... [ServicesManager.sharedInstance.roomsService archiveRoom:roomToBeArchived withCompletionBlock:^(NSError *error) { if (error) { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process } }]; NB: An archived room can still be read but nobody can post new messages Two possible cases: You are the owner: all participants are archived (the room is closed) You are a participant: you are the only one archived (you leave the room) Delete a room To delete a room, you can use the method deleteRoom as following: swift objective C let roomToBeDeleted = ... if roomToBeDeleted.isMyRoom { ServicesManager.sharedInstance().roomsService.deleteRoom(roomToBeDeleted) { error in if let error = error as? NSError { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process } } Room *roomToBeDeleted = ... if (roomToBeDeleted.isMyRoom) { Room *roomToBeArchived = ... [ServicesManager.sharedInstance.roomsService deleteRoom:roomToBeDeleted withCompletionBlock:^(NSError *error) { if (error) { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process } }]; NB: You can only delete room that you are owner Invitation To be able to discuss with users in a Rainbow room, you need to invite them into that room. This part will explain how to do that. Invite a user in a room If you are the room owner or have the organizer role you may invite contact in that room : swift objective C let contactToInvite = ... let theRoom = ... ServicesManager.sharedInstance().roomsService.invite(contactToInvite, in: theRoom) { error in if let error = error as? NSError { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process } } Contact *contactToInvite = ...; Room *theRoom = ...; [ServicesManager.sharedInstance.roomsService inviteContact: contactToInvite inRoom: theRoom completionHandler: ^(NSError *error){ if (error) { // Manage the error } else { // Continue the process } }]; Remove a user from a room If you are the room owner or have the organizer role you can remove a user from a room. A user in a room is represented by a Participant object. A member removed can still have access to the bubble to see existing messages posted before he was removed, but can not see new messages posted after he has been removed and can not post new message too. swift objective C let theRoom = ... // Returns the list of Rainbow Room participants in \"accepted\" status let participants = theRoom.getRainbowRoomParticipants() if let participant = participants?[..] { ServicesManager.sharedInstance().roomsService.remove(participant, from: theRoom) } Room *theRoom = ...; // Returns the list of Rainbow Room participants in \"accepted\" status NSArray<Participant *> *participants = [theRoom getRainbowRoomParticipants]; Participant *participant = participants[..]; [ServicesManager.sharedInstance.roomsService removeParticipant:participant fromRoom: theRoom]; Accept an invitation to a room To accept an i"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging voice and video callsLTS release 2.12.0Published on 2024-07-23Managing voice and video calls In this tutorial, you will learn how to call others Rainbow users using voice and video. By reading this tutorial, you will be able To set-up your application for having the right authorizations, To configure CallKit and ringtones for incoming and outgoing calls To call a Rainbow user To answer to an incoming call To terminate a call Additionnaly to that, you will be able to select between the front and back camera as well as to choose the right video format from your camera and adapted to your device. Limitations using an Xcode simulator Be careful when developing an application using Voice and Video calls, if you are launching your application from a Xcode simulator, you will not able to test all the different cases and possibly your application will crash. You are limited to call a Rainbow user using voice only. If you try to use the video, your application will crash. This is because the simulator don't allow your application to use a camera. There is no issue with voice call. You are limited to outgoing call. You can't receive an incoming call as Callkit is not managed by the Xcode simulator. Your application will not be alerted of incoming calls. The best practice is to use a real device. As you will see later in that tutorial, you have to use low level APIs for using the camera, selecting the right video format, etc... Coding using Swift This tutorial uses the Swift language. Objective-C code will not be provided, if needed please ask for having it in our Rainbow for developers Forum Set-up the application authorizations In order to send and receive call, the first thing to do is to add some properties in your property list (aka plist). Open the file info.plist and add the following properties: <!-- Complete file info.plist with these properties --> <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key> <string>The application needs to access the device microphone</string> <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key> <string>The application needs to access the device camera</string> <key>NSUserActivityTypes</key> <array> <string>INStartAudioCallIntent</string> </array> <key>UIBackgroundModes</key> <array> <string>audio</string> <string>voip</string> </array> You need to add the keys NSMicrophoneUsageDescription and NSCameraUsageDescription in order for your application to request access to the microphone and camera. The key UIBackgroundModes is describe more in details in tutorial Push notifications setup. Then, somewhere in your application, it could be when your application starts (ie: in your file AppDelegate.swift), you need to request the access to the microphone by calling the method requestMicrophoneAccess. func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool { // Add listener to microphone access NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(didAllowMicrophone(notification:)), name: NSNotification.Name.rtcServiceDidAllowMicrophone, object: nil) NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(didRefuseMicrophone(notification:)), name: NSNotification.Name.rtcServiceDidRefuseMicrophone, object: nil) ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.rtcService.requestMicrophoneAccess() } @objc func didAllowMicrophone(notification: NSNotification) { // Do something when the microphone access has been granted } @objc func didRefuseMicrophone(notification: NSNotification) { // Do something in case the microphone access has been declined } The next step will be to configure the ringtones to use in your application. Configure CallKit and ringtones Depending on the kind of call your application can do which can be an incoming call or an outgoing call, you can configure the ringtones and the way your are notified of an incoming call. Configuring the ringtone for outgoing calls When your application makes an outgoing call, you can configure the ringtone used by setting the property appSoundOutgoingCall. You just have to specify the path to a media file of type MP3 or WAV. ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.rtcService.appSoundOutgoingCall = \"outgoing-ringtone.mp3\" Configuring the ringtone when hanging-up a call When a call is released, you can configure a ringtone that will be played during that step. Use the property appSoundHangup to configure it. You just need to specify the path to a media file of type MP3 or WAV. ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.rtcService.appSoundHangup = \"hangup-ringtone.wav\" Configuring CallKit and ringtones for incoming calls When your application receives a call, CallKit displays a call screen with 2 buttons allowing the user to accept or decline the call. In that CallKit screen, you can configure the ringtone to use and the text and icon that appear. For that, use the method startCallKit like in the following ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.rtcService.startCallKit(withIncomingSound"

It is required to configure push notifications as you will need a push notification certificate for your App ID. Development and Production push notification certificates Go to Apple developer portal and click on App IDs in the Identifiers category on the left. Select your App ID and click on Edit button at the end of the App Services section to enable push notifications service for this App ID. Create a development or production SSL certificate for push by following process given by Apple. Read the information and follow the instructions to create a CSR using Keychain Access in macOS. When you have the CSR file return to the developer portal with your web browser and click Continue. Select the CSR file you just created and saved and click Continue. Click Download to download the certificate (give it the aps.cer name). Open the downloaded certificate file (it should automatically be opened in Keychain Access, otherwise open it manually in Keychain Access). Find the certificate you just opened/imported in Keychain Access and expand the certificate to show the Private Key. Export the certificate from the keychain and save it with a specific name for production or development, for example rainbow-production-cert.p12 or rainbow-development-cert.p12. (right click, export and enter your password) Expend the certificate and export the private key associated to this certificate, for example rainbow-production-key.p12 or rainbow-development-key.p12. (right click, export and enter your password) These files need to be converted to the PEM format by executing these commands from the terminal (Please always enter a passphrase and replace the correct file name for production or development): $ openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -out rainbow-production-cert.pem -in rainbow-production-cert.p12 $ openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out rainbow-production-key.pem -in rainbow-production-key.p12 Remove the passphrase from the PEM file key : $ openssl rsa -in rainbow-production-key.pem -out rainbow-production-key-noenc.pem Combine the key and cert files into a cert-production.pem : $ cat rainbow-production-cert.pem rainbow-production-key-noenc.pem > cert-production.pem Upload the cert-production.pem file with Rainbow CLI or directly by using your developer dashboard on Rainbow Hub. For the Rainbow Sandbox certificate repeat all commands from step 12 to create your cert-development.pem VoIP Services certificate Go to Apple developer portal and click on All in the Certificates category on the left. Click the Add button (+) in the upper-right corner. Select VoIP Services Certificate under Production section and click Continue. Select an App ID for your VoIP Service Certificate and click Continue. Read the information and follow the instructions to create a CSR using Keychain Access in macOS. When you have the CSR file return to the developer portal with your web browser and click Continue. Select the CSR file you just created and saved and click Continue. Click Download to download the certificate (give it the voip_services.cer name). Open the downloaded certificate file (it should automatically be opened in Keychain Access, otherwise open it manually in Keychain Access). Find the certificate you just opened/imported in Keychain Access and expand the certificate to show the Private Key. Export the certificate from the keychain and save it with a specific name for production or development, for example rainbow-voip-cert.p12.

    "content": "DocumentationServiceabilityLTS release 2.13.0Published on 2025-03-07Serviceability Getting the SDK version The Rainbow SDK version could be retrieved like this (SDK version > 2.9.0), for example in the AppDelegate of the app: swift objective-c let sdkVersion = ServicesManager.version() NSString *sdkVersion = ServicesManager.version; Stopping the SDK At any time, you can stop the connection to Rainbow by calling the API disconnect. This will stop all services. The only way to reconnect is to call the API connect again. swift objective C NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(didLogout(notification:)), name: NSNotification.Name(kLoginManagerDidLogoutSucceeded), object: nil) ServicesManager.sharedInstance()?.loginManager.disconnect() ServicesManager.sharedInstance().loginManager.resetAllCredentials() [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(didLogout:) name:kLoginManagerDidLogoutSucceeded object:nil]; [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].loginManager disconnect]; [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].loginManager resetAllCredentials]; Logging The logs emitted by the Rainbow SDK could be redirected to the Documents directory (NSDocumentsDirectory) of the app using the SDK. When the log recording is started using startRecord method of LogRecorder service a log files named according to this template : log_[applicationName]-[applicationVersion]_dd-MM-yyyy HH_mm_ss.txt such as log_Rainbow-1.0.1_06-11-2019 18_09_42.txt is created in Documents directory and appended with live logs. Starting and stopping log recording If you want to record all logs coming from the Rainbow SDK you should start the recording in the init method of your AppDelegate : swift objective C override init() { LogsRecorder.sharedInstance().startRecord() } +(void)initialize { if (self == [AppDelegate self]) { [super initialize]; [[LogsRecorder sharedInstance] startRecord]; } } To stop the log recording you should call [[LogsRecorder sharedInstance] stopRecord], this flush all pending write to the logs file and close it. You may call stopRecord in ApplicationWillTerminate method : swift objective C func applicationWillTerminate(_ application: UIApplication) { LogsRecorder.sharedInstance().stopRecord() } - (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application { [[LogsRecorder sharedInstance] stopRecord]; } Note: Each time the startRecord method is called a new log file is created. Retrieving the log files File sharing The log files are created at the root of your app Documents directory so they are visible in the iTunes app in the File sharing section when this feature is activated in XCode. To activate the file sharing for your app you should set the Application supports iTunes file sharing property to YES in the app's Info.plist file: Zipping log files LogRecorder service provide the -(NSURL *) zippedApplicationLogs method that compress all the log files together and return a NSURL to the resulting file, you could then transmit using eMail, or filetransfer. The zipped file is also created in the app Documents directory, then it is accessible in the File sharing if activated and could be retrieved manually using iTunes. Note: You should call stopRecord before calling zippedApplicationLogs, then startRecord again. Cleaning log files The LogRecorderservice provide several methods to clean the generated log files : swift objective C /** * Remove log files older than 2 days and also the zipped log archive if any. */ func cleanOldLogs() /** * Delete all log files */ func deleteAllLogs() -> Int /** * Delete a log file * @param logName the name of the log file * @return `YES` if the item was removed successfully */ func deleteLog(_ logName: String!) -> Bool /** * Delete a log files created before a given date * @param date the date * @return `YES` if the item was removed successfully */ deleteLogs(before: Date) -> Bool /** * Remove log files older than 2 days and also the zipped log archive if any. */ -(void) cleanOldLogs; /** * Delete all log files */ -(NSInteger) deleteAllLogs; /** * Delete a log file * @param logName the name of the log file * @return `YES` if the item was removed successfully */ -(BOOL) deleteLog:(NSString*)logName; /** * Delete a log files created before a given date * @param date the date * @return `YES` if the item was removed successfully */ -(NSArray*) deleteLogsBefore:(NSDate*)date; You may at least call the cleanOldLogs method in the applicationWillTerminate of your app to clean older log files and avoid to consume too much space on the device. Note: You should call stopRecord before calling these methods.

In Rainbow, conversations are the way to get in touch with someone or something (i.e. a Rainbow contact, a external phone number, a connected thing, ...) so a conversation is the \"long tail\" of communication between you and someone or something else like a bubble. A Rainbow conversation by default supports sending and receiving Instant Messages with a single recipient (one-to-one conversation) or with several persons (bubble). Using the FileStorage service, you can share files in conversations. The main methods and events proposed in that service allow to: Create or close a Rainbow conversation (one-to-one of bubble), Get all conversations or get a conversation by Id, bubbleID or bubbleJid Retrieve all information linked to that conversation, Access: public Version: 2.42.0-lts.0 - Documentation generated on 2025/10/17T17:36:59.491Z ConversationsService CONVERSATIONS getTheNumberOfHitsOfASubstringInAllUsersconversations(userId, substring, limit, webinar) ⇒ Object getAllConversations() ⇒ Array.<Conversation> openConversationForContact(contact) ⇒ Conversation openConversationForBubble(bubble) ⇒ Promise.<Conversation> getS2SServerConversation(conversationId) ⇒ Conversation deleteServerConversation(conversationId) ⇒ Promise sendConversationByEmail(conversationDbId, emails, lang) ⇒ Promise.<Array.<Conversation>> getConversationById(conversationId) ⇒ Conversation getConversationByDbId(dbId) ⇒ Conversation getConversationByBubbleId(bubbleId) ⇒ Conversation getConversationByBubbleJid(bubbleJid) ⇒ Conversation getBubbleConversation(bubbleJid, conversationDbId, lastModification, lastMessageText, missedIMCounter, noError, muted, creationDate, lastMessageSender) ⇒ Promise.<Conversation> closeConversation(conversation) ⇒ Promise cleanConversations() ⇒ Promise.<any> MESSAGES ackAllMessages(conversationDbId, maskRead) ⇒ Promise.<Array.<Conversation>> getHistoryPage(conversation, size, useBulk) ⇒ Promise.<Array.<Conversation>> getS2SMessagesByConversationId(conversationId, limit, before, after) ⇒ Promise.<any> loadConversationHistory(conversation, pageSize, useBulk) ⇒ Promise.<Array.<Conversation>> loadConversationHistoryAsync(conversation, pageSize, useBulk) ⇒ Promise.<{code:number, label:string}> getOneMessageFromConversationId(conversationId, messageId, stamp) ⇒ Promise.<any> getContactsMessagesFromConversationId(conversationId, useBulk) ⇒ Promise.<any> sendExistingFSMessage(conversation, message, fileDescriptor, p_messagesDataStore) ⇒ Message sendCorrectedChatMessage(conversation, data, origMsgId, content, urgency, p_messagesDataStore) ⇒ Promise.<string> deleteMessage(conversation, messageId, p_messagesDataStore) ⇒ Message deleteAllMessageInOneToOneConversation(conversation) ⇒ Message removeAllMessages(conversation) ⇒ Promise removeMessagesFromConversation(conversation, date, number) ⇒ Promise sendIsTypingState(conversation, status, p_messagesDataStore) ⇒ updateConversationBookmark(userId, conversationId, messageId) ⇒ Object deleteConversationBookmark(userId, conversationId) ⇒ Object showAllMatchingMessagesForAPeer(userId, substring, peer, isRoom, limit) ⇒ Promise.<any> conversationsService.getTheNumberOfHitsOfASubstringInAllUsersconversations(userId, substring, limit, webinar) ⇒ Object This API can be used to search a text substring in all conversations for a given user from recent to old messages.

    "content": "DocumentationAnswering to chat messagesLTS release 2.XPublished on 2025-01-01Answering to Chat Messages Preamble As the SDK for Node.JS is a server side component, it could act as a Bot that is always connected to Rainbow and so that can interact with users that request help or that send text messages to it. This tutorial explains in details how to listen to incoming messages and how to answer to them. Listening to incoming messages The Rainbow SDK for Node.JS can listen to messages posted in bubbles (where the connected user belongs) or posted direcly to the connected user. Listening to incoming messages coming from a user Listening to instant messages that come from other users is very easy. You have just to use the events public property and to subscribe to the rainbow_onmessagereceived event like in the following code sample: ... rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onmessagereceived', (message) => { // Check if the message comes from a user if(message.type === \"chat\") { // Do something with the message ... } }); You can have more details about the message structure by looking to the Message API documentation. Listening to incoming messages sending to a bubble Messages posted to a bubble can be listened using the same way as messages coming from users. Use the event rainbow_onmessagereceived to handle them as described: ... rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onmessagereceived', (message) => { // Check if the message comes from a user if(message.type === \"groupchat\") { // Do something with the message ... } }); For bubble messages, the type property has a value equals to groupchat whereas the value is chat for simple messages exchanged with a user. Be careful, when using the property fromJid of the message. When in a bubble, the fromJid property contains the identity of the user inside the bubble so follows the pattern jid_room/jid_user. Answering to messages Once you know how to detect and interpret incoming messages, the next steps are to send receipts and to answer to these messages. Managing received receipts When receiving an incoming message, the SDK for Node.JS automatically sends a receipt of type received to inform the user that the message has been well handled. So, on your side, you have nothing to do. The user will be informed that your application has received the message. Sending read receipts automatically The receipt of type read (that inform that the message has been read or interpreted) can be managed automatically or manually depending the configuration of the option sendreadreceipt. If you want that a receipt of type read is sent automatically to the sender, you have to set the parameter sendReadReceipt of the configuration to true like in the following: // Define your configuration let options = { // Rainbow platform \"rainbow\": { \"host\": \"sandbox\" }, // Identity used \"credentials\": { \"login\": \"bot@mycompany.com\", \"password\": \"thePassword!123\" }, ... // IM options \"im\": { \"sendReadReceipt\": true // True to send the 'read' receipt automatically } }; This is the default option: Receipt of type read is sent automatically on each new message received. If you want to manage it manually, set the value to false. Sending read receipt manually In some cases, you want to send the receipt of type read manually (eg: to acknowledge an alarm message only if other command has been done sucessfully), so you can set the parameter sendReadReceipt to false and use the API markMessageAsRead() to send it manually. Here is an example: // Define your configuration let options = { // Rainbow platform \"rainbow\": { \"host\": \"sandbox\" }, // Identity used \"credentials\": { \"login\": \"bot@mycompany.com\", \"password\": \"thePassword!123\" }, ... // IM options \"im\": { \"sendReadReceipt\": false // Do not send a receipt of type read automatically } }; // Later in the code rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onmessagereceived', (message) => { // do something with the message received ... // send manually a 'read' receipt to the sender rainbowSDK.im.markMessageAsRead(message); }); Notice: You don't have to send receipt for messages having the property isEvent equals to true. These messages are specific Bubble messages not sent by a user and indicating that someone entered the bubble or just leaved it. Sending a message to a recipient If you want to send a message to a recipient, once you have to do is to call the API sendMessageToJid(). For example, if you want to answer to an incoming message from a user, do the following rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_onmessagereceived\", (message) => { // Check if the message is not from you if(!message.fromJid.includes(rainbowSDK.connectedUser.jid_im)) { // Check that the message is from a user and not a bot if( message.type === \"chat\") { // Answer to this user rainbowSDK.im.sendMessageToJid(\"hello! How may I help you?\", message.fromJid); // Do something with the message sent ... } } }); In order to avoid loop, it's always a good practice to check if the sender is not you as you can be connected several times"

This guide will describe in details how to configure the SDK for Node.JS in order to help you understanding what's wrong. Retrieving SDK version If you need the information, at any time, you can retrieve the SDK Node.JS version by calling the API version.

Configuring logs The SDK for Node.JS lets you configuring how you want to get the logs. You can define to have access to logs from the console, from a file or from both. Console logger Activate - deactivate logger By default, the Rainbow SDK for Node.js logs to the shell console used (ie. the shell console that starts the Node.js process). You can disable it by setting the parameter enableConsoleLogs to false. You can add a custom label added in logs (helpful when multiple instances of sdk are running) ... logs: { enableConsoleLogs: false, customLabel: 'Vincent02' ... } When using the console logger, all logs are displayed.

The Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (ALE) Rainbow Software Development Kit (SDK) is an NPM package based on JavaScript for connecting your Node.js application to Rainbow. This powerfull library enables you to create the best Node.js applications that connect to Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow. This tutorial will help you starting with the ALE Rainbow SDK for Node.JS by building a basic application that connects to Rainbow. Prerequisites Node.JS and NPM You need to have Node.JS and NPM installed on your computer if you want to develop using the ALE Rainbow SDK for Node.JS The minimal versions supported are: Pre-requisitesVersion supportedMinimal Node.JSActive LTS version only is supportedStarting 10.x (without support) NPMActive LTS version is supportedStarting 6.x (without support) Note: We encourage you to migrate and to keep closer to the active LTS version of Node.JS in order to let us write this SDK using the latest JavaScript and Node.JS evolutions in term of language, and to have the best of Node.JS in term of features and security. Current version of Node.JS (with latest features) can be used but without support too. Platforms supported The following OS are supported: Operating SystemVersion supported WindowsStarting Windows 7 MacOSStarting OS X 10.11 LinuxCompatible with Debian, Ubuntu For developping using the Rainbow Developers Sandboxed Platform For developping on the Rainbow Developers Sandboxed Platform, your need a Developer account in order to use the Rainbow SDK for Node.js. To obtain it, you have to connect to the Rainbow for Developers and to follow the instructions. Or you can contact the Rainbow support team if you need one. Or ask our bot Emily for an account. Just add the tags #support #api to your message sent to Emily. For deploying in the Rainbow Production environment Once your application is ready and you want to deploy it on the Rainbow Production environment, you need to have a Rainbow official account to use it in your application. You can create a new one by connecting to Rainbow. Building a new Node.JS application Here are the steps you have to do for creating your first application using the ALE Rainbow SDK for Node.JS that connects to Rainbow. Initializing your application To create your application, first, you need a fresh directory to put your source files. Open a shell and execute these commands to create the application's directory and initialize your application. $ mkdir \"my-nodeApp\" $ cd my-NodeApp $ npm init Then answer to the question. For most of them, you have just to answer Yes. Once you have finished, the file package.json is created and ready for your application. Installing the ALE Rainbow SDK for Node.JS You can now install the SDK. In the shell, execute the following command to install the ALE Rainbow SDK for Node.JS $ npm install --save rainbow-node-sdk Once installed, the file package.json will be updated and your application now depends on the SDK. You are now ready to code... Loading and starting the SDK You need a file to write your code. Add the file index.js to your directory using your code editor or using a shell command $ touch index.js Then edit this file and add the following code to load and start the SDK: // Load the SDK let RainbowSDK = require(\"rainbow-node-sdk\"); // Instantiate the SDK let rainbowSDK = new RainbowSDK(options); // Start the SDK rainbowSDK.start(); That's all for the JavaScript code. Using these 3 lines of codes, you have an application that when launched is connected to Rainbow. But to be complete, we need to fill the parameter options wich will describe all the configuration used by the SDK Configuring your SDK (in XMPP mode) The options parameter allows to enter your credentials and to target the Rainbow platform to use. Add these lines before instantiating the SDK: // Load the SDK let RainbowSDK = require(\"rainbow-node-sdk\"); // Define your configuration let level = \"error\"; let logLevelAreas = new LogLevelAreas(level, false, false, false); let options = { \"rainbow\": { \"host\": \"sandbox\", \"mode\": \"xmpp\" }, \"credentials\": { \"login\": \"bot@mycompany.com\", // To replace by your developer credendials \"password\": \"thePassword!123\" // To replace by your developer credentials }, \"xmpp\": { \"host\": \"\", \"port\": \"443\", \"protocol\": \"wss\", \"timeBetweenXmppRequests\": \"20\", \"raiseLowLevelXmppInEvent\": false, \"raiseLowLevelXmppOutReq\": false, \"maxIdleTimer\": 16000, \"maxPingAnswerTimer\": 11000, \"xmppRessourceName\": \"vnagw\" }, \"s2s\": { \"hostCallback\": urlS2S, //\"hostCallback\": \"http://70a0ee9d.ngrok.io\", \"locallistenningport\": \"4000\" }, // Application identifier \"application\": { \"appID\": \"\", \"appSecret\": \"\" }, // Proxy configuration \"proxy\": { \"host\": undefined, \"port\": 8080, \"protocol\": undefined, \"user\": undefined, \"password\": undefined, \"secureProtocol"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging bubblesLTS release 2.XPublished on 2025-01-01Managing Bubbles Preamble Using the Rainbow SDK for Node.JS, you have the possibility to create and administrate Bubbles as well as to participate to the discussion. This guide is focussed on the management of the Bubbles. If you need to know how to send and receive messages in Bubbles, have a look to the guide Answering to Chat Messages. Retrieve the list of existing bubbles The first thing to do when connecting to Rainbow with the SDK for Node.JS is to get the existing list of Bubbles where the connected user is. Hopefully, this is done automatically by the SDK and once the event rainbow_onready you have access to this list by calling the API getAll() like in the following sample: ... rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onready', function() { // Do something when the connection to Rainbow is done and the SDK is ready to be used let bubbles = rainbowSDK.bubbles.getAll(); // Do something with the list of bubbles ... }); Each new bubble created will then be added to that list automatically. Same when Bubbles have been removed or updated, this list is updated. Note: Others methods like getAllPendingBubbles(), getAllActiveBubbles() and getAllClosedBubbles() are available to get the list of bubbles where the connected user is invited, where the connected user is active and that are closed. Retrieve a bubble information If you know the id or the JID of an existing bubble, you can access to the information by calling the API getBubbleByJid() or getBubbleById() like in that sample: ... // Retrieve the bubble information when receiving a message from a bubble rainbowSDK.bubbles.getBubbleByJid(message.fromBubbleJid).then(function(bubble) { // do something with the bubble ... }).catch(function(err) { // do something if something went wrong by getting the bubble ... }); Create a new Bubble At any time, you can create a new bubble by calling the API createBubble(). Depending your need you can create a bubble with history or not. By setting the parameter withHistory to true will allow newcomers to have access to the complete history of the bubble and so newcomers can read all messages exchanged before their entrance to the bubble. By setting this parameter to false, only new messages exchanged will be seen by newcomers. ... let withHistory = true; // Allow newcomers to have access to the bubble messages since the creation of the bubble rainbowSDK.bubbles.createBubble(\"My new Bubble\", \"A little description of my bubble\", withHistory).then(function(bubble) { // do something with the bubble created ... }).catch(function(err) { // do something if the creation of the bubble failed (eg. providing the same name as an existing bubble) ... }); Once the bubble is created, you can then invite or add Rainbow users to that bubble. Inviting a Rainbow user to a bubble To invite a Rainbow user to one of your bubble, use the API inviteContactToBubble() like in the following: ... let invitedAsModerator = false; // To set to true if you want to invite someone as a moderator let sendAnInvite = true; // To set to false if you want to add someone to a bubble without having to invite him first let inviteReason = \"bot-invite\"; // Define a reason for the invite (part of the invite received by the recipient) rainbowSDK.bubbles.inviteContactToBubble(aContact, aBubble, invitedAsModerator, sendAnInvite, inviteReason).then(function(bubbleUpdated) { // do something with the invite sent ... }).catch(function(err) { // do something if the invitation failed (eg. bad reference to a buble) ... }); The user will then receive an invitation to join the bubble and can accept or decline the invitation. Inviting a Rainbow user to a bubble as a moderator You can invite a Rainbow user as a new moderator of the Bubble by calling the same API inviteContactToBubble() and setting the parameter invitedAsModerator to true like in the following: ... let invitedAsModerator = true; // To set to true if you want to invite someone as a moderator let sendAnInvite = true; // To set to false if you want to add someone to a bubble without having to invite him first let inviteReason = \"bot-invite\"; // Define a reason for the invite (part of the invite received by the recipient) rainbowSDK.bubbles.inviteContactToBubble(aContact, aBubble, invitedAsModerator, sendAnInvite, inviteReason).then(function(bubbleUpdated) { // do something with the invite sent ... }).catch(function(err) { // do something if the invitation failed (eg. bad reference to a buble) ... }); If a user is invited as a moderator, it will have the right to invite or ban users and change the bubble parameters and data. Inviting users by email to a bubble You can invite few users by emails to the Bubble by calling the API inviteContactsByEmailsToBubble(): ... let utc = new Date().toJSON().replace(/-/g, '/'); rainbowSDK.bubbles.createBubble(\"TestInviteByEmails\" + utc, \"TestInviteByEmails\" + utc).then((bubble) => { let contacts = []; contacts.push(\"invited.01@"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging channelsLTS release 2.XPublished on 2025-01-01Managing Channels Preamble Using the Rainbow SDK for Node.JS, you can send notifications to a large numbers of users (e.i. several thousands of users) using a channel. Channel can be used when you want to notify a large group of users without having to send a chat message individually to each. You can create and administrate 2 differents types of channels: Either by managing the recipients (called private channels) or by letting the users subscribing to the channel they want (called public channels) if they find an interest to receive these information. Channel typeDescription PrivateOnly Owner can add or remove users in a private channels. Private channels can't be found when searching for channels. Consequently, users can't subscribe on their own to private channel. PublicUsers are free to subscribe to a public channel. Public channels can be found when searching for channels. The visibility of a channel is limited to my company. In a channel, the membership of a user (role) can be owner, member, publisher or none. User roleDescription OwnerThe owner is the user who creates the channel. A owner can modify information of the channel, can invite other users (including new owners) can publish messages and can receive incoming messages PublisherA publisher is a member of a channel who can publish messages in that channel and can receive incoming messages MemberA member of a channel can only receive incoming messages NoneA user with this particular role is a user who left the channel (by his own or removed by a owner) Retrieving the list of existing channels Once connected to Rainbow, the SDK for Node.JS will automatically retrieve the channels where you are owner and the channels where you have subscribed (by your own or by an owner). To access to the list of channels, you have to call the API getAllChannels() such as in the following samples: ... rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onready', function() { let channels = rainbowSDK.channels.getAllChannels(); // Do something with the channel created ... }); Each time you create a new channel or you subscribe to a new one, this list will be updated. Same thing will happens when you unsubscribe or when you delete a channel. Note: Others methods like getAllOwnedChannels() and getAllSubscribedChannels() are available to get the list of channels you own or the list of channels you subscribed. Retrieve a channel information by its id If you know the id of an existing channel, you can access to the information by calling the API fetchChannel() as follows: ... let channelId = \"...\"; // Retrieve the bubble information when receiving a message from a bubble rainbowSDK.channels.fetchChannel(channelId).then((channel) => { // Do something with the channel ... }).catch((err) => { // Do something in case of error ... }); }); Note: Using this API, if the channel is not found locally, a request is sent to the server to retrieve it. Creating channels Channels can be created by using the API createPublicChannel() or createPrivateChannel(). Creating a new private channel In order to create a new private channel, add the following code: rainbowSDK.channels.createPrivateChannel(\"a private channel\", \"The description of my private channel\").then((channel) => { // Do something with the channel created ... }).catch(err) { // Do something in case of error ... }); Creating a new public channel You have to use the API createPublicChannel() for creating a public channel as in the following: When creating a public channel, only users from the same company can found this channel and subscribe to it. rainbowSDK.channels.createPublicChannel(\"a company channel\", \"The description of my channel limited to my company\").then((channel) => { // Do something with the channel created ... }).catch(err) { // Do something in case of error ... }); Updating a channel At any time, as a owner, you can update the channel description by using the API updateChannelDescription() as follows: rainbowSDK.channels.updateChannelDescription(channel, \"The new description of my channel\").then((channelUpdated) => { // Do something with the channel updated ... }).catch(err) { // Do something in case of error . ... }); Adding and removing users in private channel Like mentionned in the preamble, in a private channel, the users can't subscribe on their own. So, the owner has to add a list of users to a private channel so that these users are able to receive messages sent on that channel. The followin paragraphes describe how to add users in a channel depending on the role you want to attach to these users. Adding new members to a private channel New users with role members can be added to a channel using the API addMembersToChannel() as in the following code: let channel = <...> // A channel let users = [..] // A list of users rainbowSDK.channels.addMembersToChannel(channel, users).then((channelUpdated) => { // Do something once the users have been added to the cha"

This guide is focussed on the management of the Bubbles. If you need to know how to send and receive messages in Bubbles, have a look to the guide Answering to Chat Messages. Managing conferences This guide explains how to manage conferences from a bubble: get list of participants, mute/unmute participant, drop participant, get list of publishers Publishers are people using media others than audio like sharing or video The short term Conference is used as a reference to WebRTC conference: the audio part is done in WebRTC. Then another media can be added (sharing, video) alos in WebRTC. Check permissions First thing to do, it's to check if the user can make conferences. For this conferenceAllowed methods must be used from Bubbles object. ... //Once connected // Is the WebRTC conference allowed ? let conferenceAllowed = rainbowSDK.bubbles.conferenceAllowed(); ... WebRTC conferences Web conferences are linked to bubbles. Bubbles has confEndpoints property which describe the id of conference. To get current conferences you can call the BubblesService::retrieveConferences API. The WebRTC conferences can not be joined from node SDK because a WebRTC stack is need, and none is integrated in it. So it has to be done from common UI. ... //Once connected // @deprecated rainbowSDK.bubbles.retrieveConferences(undefined, false, false).then((conferences) => { console.log(\"(retrieveConferences) conferences : \", conferences); }); ... // Retrieve my owned bubbles and select one by name. let bubbles = rainbowSDK.bubbles.getAllOwnedBubbles(); let myBubbleToConferenced = null; for (const bubble of bubbles) { if (bubble.name === \"BullesOfTests\") { console.log(\"Found BullesOfTests bubble : \", bubble); myBubbleToConferenced = bubble; } } let conferencId = null; // Start a conference linked to the bubble provided in poarameter. rainbowSDK.bubbles.startConferenceOrWebinarInARoom(myBubbleToConferenced.id).then((result) => { // the id of the conference is in the result of the start in confId properties. // It allow to follow the life of the bubble with the `rainbow_onbubbleconferenceupdated` event (see bellow). // Note that only a first event is received with the `participant::connected` property to false. logger.log(\"debug\", \"(conferenceStart) result : \", result); // To get the events of conference's life, it is necessary to join the conference. rainbowSDK.bubbles.joinConferenceV2(bubbleId).then(async (result) => { // to retrieve initial state of the conference ask a snapshot. Note that event should also give the informations. rainbowSDK.bubbles.snapshotConference(bubbleId).then(async (result) => { ... }).catch(err => { }); }).catch(err => { }); }); ... // stop the conference rainbowSDK.bubbles.stopConferenceOrWebinar(conferencId).then((result) => { // logger.log(\"debug\", \"(conferenceStop) result : \", result); }); Follow conference update - WebRTC To follow the status of conference in progress use rainbow_onbubbleconferencestartedreceived rainbow_onbubbleconferencestoppedreceived rainbow_onbubbleconferenceupdated events (same events WebRTC conference). You can know the list of participants and their status (moderator or not, muted or not), the list of publishers (using \"sharing\" and or \"video\"), and the current talkers. // Subscribe events before the start of the SDK . // event when a conference is started rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_onbubbleconferencestartedreceived\", (bubble: Bubble) => { console.log(\"debug\", \"MAIN - (rainbow_onbubbleconferencestartedreceived) - received. bubble : \", bubble); }); // event when a conference is stopped rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_onbubbleconferencestoppedreceived\", (bubble: Bubble) => { console.log(\"debug\", \"MAIN - (rainbow_onbubbleconferencestoppedreceived) - received. bubble : \", bubble); }); // event when a conference status or properties updated. rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_onbubbleconferenceupdated\", (conference: ConferenceSession) => { console.log(\"debug\", \"MAIN - (rainbow_onbubbleconferenceupdated) - received. conference : \", conference); }); ... Specials usecases When the conference is already started when the sdk before the SDK then a rainbow_onbubbleconferenceupdated event will be raised with its information. When the conference is started, but the connected user has not joined (or has leaved) the conference then the ConferenceSession object of the rainbow_onbubbleconferenceupdated event will have isActive field be true, and the participants list is empty. When this conference is finaly ended then an event rainbow_onbubbleconferenceupdated with property isActive field setted to false, and the participants setted to an empty list, is raised. When the conference is delegated to an other moderator of the bubble, then the conference is replaced by a ne"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging favoritesLTS release 2.XPublished on 2025-01-01Managing Favorites Rainbow Node SDK allows you to store links to conversations with Users and Bubbles in a handy list called Favorites. Favorites are essentially a JavaScript array containing objects. Each of those objects the following properties: type - describing a type of a Favorite. Can be set either to user or bubble id - representing an ID of a Favorite peerId - a dbId property of a Bubble or User that is linked to Favorite object contact or room - essentially a contact or bubble object that is linked to Favorite item With those four you will have a good peak on what Users or Bubbles are the most used and essential for the application. Retrieving Favorites List You can retrieve Favorites List from the server by calling fetchAllFavorites() method that returns an Array. Favorites Array can be empty when no User or Bubble has been added to Favorites. It is an asynchronous method, therefore it returns a Promise containing the Favorites Array. // somewhere in your code rainbowSDK.favorites.fetchAllFavorites() .then(function (favorites) { // do something with the Favorites Array retrieved from the server }) .catch(function (err) { console.log (err) }) Creating a Favorite To create a Favorite (add a new object to the Favorites list), use the favorites.createFavorite() method which accepts a Bubble or User dbId and type as arguments. createFavorite() returns a Promise due to its asynchronous nature. A snippet below shows how to create a Favorite of each of the types: let user = UserObject; let bubble = BubbleObject; // Create a new Favorite from an User: rainbowSDK.favorites.createFavorite(user.id, \"user\") .then( /* do something once the Favorite has been created */) .catch( /* do something in case of an error */) // Create a new Favorite from a Bubble: rainbowSDK.favorites.createFavorite(bubble.id, \"bubble\") .then( /* do something once the Favorite has been created */) .catch( /* do something in case of an error */) Once a new Favorite is created, an event is going to be sent. Think of it as a confirmation of the successful Favorite creation process. // somewhere in your code: rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onfavoritecreated', (data) => { logger.log(\"debug\", \"rainbow_onfavoritecreated - rainbow event received.\", data); }); Deleting a Favorite Analogically, it is possible to delete a Favorite from the Favorites list by calling the favorites.deleteFavorite() method which accepts a Favorite ID string. It is asynchronous and it returns a Promise. let favorite = FavoriteObject; // Favorite Object // Delete a Favorite rainbowSDK.favorites.deleteFavorite(favorite.id) .then(/* do something once the Favorite has been deleted */) .catch(/* do something in case of an error */) Similarly to creating a Favorite, while deleting one, an event will be dispatched. It is a definite confirmation that a Favorite has been deleted. rainbowSDK.events.on('rainbow_onfavoritedeleted', (data) => { logger.log(\"debug\", \"rainbow_onfavoritedeleted - rainbow event received.\", data); }); Last updated july, 8 2019 On this pageManaging FavoritesRetrieving Favorites ListCreating a FavoriteDeleting a FavoriteWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging groupsLTS release 2.XPublished on 2025-01-01Managing Groups Preamble The Rainbow SDK for Node.JS allows to gather contacts into groups in order to organize them using any business logic you need. Once grouped, you can retrieve only contacts belonging to a specific group. This allows you to do actions on somes contacts and not on others. This tutorial explains how to use these APIs. Creating a new group A new group can be created by calling the API createGroup(). To create a new group, you need to add a name, a description and to choose if the group is a favorite group of not. Note: Favorite groups are not different but can be filtered and retrieved separately using API getFavoriteGroups(). let isFavorite = true; // Creation of a new group rainbowSDK.groups.createGroup(\"aFavoriteGroup\", \"This is a favorite group\", isFavorite).then((groupCreated) => { // Do something once the group has been created ... }).catch((err) => { // Do something in case of issue when creating the group ... }); Updating the name of a group You can update the name of a group by calling the API updateGroupName() let aGroup = ...; let aNewName = ...; rainbowSDK.groups.updateGroupName(aGroup, aNewName).then(group => { // Do something once the name of the group has been updated }).catch(err => { // Do something in case of issue }); Adding a user to a group Once you have created a group, you can add users by calling the API addUserInGroup() let aGroup = ...; let aContact = ...; rainbowSDK.groups.addUserInGroup(aContact, aGroup).then((group) => { // Do something once the user has been added to the group ... }).catch((err) => { // Do something in case of issue when adding a user to that group ... }); Querying groups For retrieving the list of users in a specific group, the following API getGroupById() and getGroupByName() can be used: // Get a group by its name let familyGroup = rainbowSDK.groups.getGroupByName('familyGroup'); // Get a group by its id let otherGroup = rainbowSDK.groups.getGroupById('59e7b508de8b80386e0cfc5d'); Once you have a group, the property users let you access to the list of users of this group. Removing a user from a group At any time, you can remove a user from a group by calling the API removeUserFromGroup() like in the follofing sample: let aGroup = ...; let aContact = ...; rainbowSDK.groups.removeUserFromGroup(aContact, aGroup).then((groupUpdated) => { // Do something once the contact has been removed from the group ... }).catch((err) => { // Do something in case of issue when removing a user from that group ... }); Retrieving groups If you want to retrieve all your groups, you have to call the API getAll() like in the following: // Get the existing groups let groups = rainbowSDK.groups.getAll(); // Do something with the groups. ... Retrieving favorite groups You can retrieve only the favorite groups by calling the API getFavoriteGroups(): // Get the existing groups let favoriteGroups = rainbowSDK.groups.getFavoriteGroups(); // Do something with the favorite groups. ... Deleting a group A group can be deleted by calling the APi deleteGroup() even if there is users in that group. let aGroup = ...; rainbowSDK.groups.deleteGroup(aGroup).then((groupDeleted) => { // Do something once the group has been deleted ... }).catch((err) => { // Do something in case of issue when deleting a group ... }); Events When using the Groups API, the Rainbow SDK for Node.JS fired events each time something happens on your groups. To subscribe to any events, just add the following lines of code: rainbowSDK.events.on(\"<event_name>\", (<parameters>) => { // Do something once the event has fired ... }); Here is the list of events you can subscribe when using the Groups API: EventDescription rainbow_ongroupcreatedFired when a group has been successfully created rainbow_ongroupupdatedFired when a modification occurs on a group rainbow_ongroupdeletedFired when a group has been deleted rainbow_onuseraddedingroupFired when a user has been added to a group rainbow_onuserremovedfromgroupFired when a user has been removed from a group Groups at a glance CriteriaDescription Group nameThe field name must be unique Group nameThe length of the field name is between 1 and 255 characters Group descriptionThe length of the field description field is between 1 and 255 characters Last updated October, 19th 2017 On this pageManaging GroupsPreambleCreating a new groupUpdating the name of a groupAdding a user to a groupQuerying groupsRemoving a user from a groupRetrieving groupsRetrieving favorite groupsDeleting a groupEventsGroups at a glanceWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

    "content": "DocumentationManaging RPC over XMPPLTS release 2.XPublished on 2025-01-01Managing Remote Procedure Call over XMPP Preamble The SDK for Node.JS lets you share RPC methods to other XMPP client. It also lets you build a RPC client over XMPP to call method on RPC Server. This guide helps you understanding the API for managing and to use the SDK's RPC Service. RPC Server Once started, you can manage the RPC Service. You can add or remove RPC methods in the RPC engine. The methods shared by the server are qualified by properties : methodName {string} The name of the method to be added in RPC server. This is the name used by the RPC Client to call it. methodCallback {string} The callback of the method to be added in RPC server. It is this method which is called when the SDK receives an RPC request for the linked methodName. methodSignature {string} The method signature. It is auto built from the callback parameter. methodDescription {string} The description of the method to be added in RPC server. methodHelp {string} The help of the method to be added in RPC server. It is return to client when it requires the system.methodHelp of it. The RPC Server provide already shared methods : system.listMethods This method returns a list of the methods the server has, by name. There are no parameters. system.methodSignature This method returns a description of the argument format a particular method expects. The method takes one parameter, an XML-RPC string. Its value is the name of the XML-RPC method about which information is being requested. system.methodHelp This method returns a text description of a particular method. The method takes one parameter, an XML-RPC string. Its value is the name of the XML-RPC method about which information is being requested. Manage RPC Service To add methods in the RPC Server Manager to share it you must provide methodName, methodCallback, methodDescription, methodHelp parameters. rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_onready\", async () => { // Add method to RPC Server let resultOfAdd = await rainbowSDK.rpcoverxmpp.addRPCMethod(\"example.trace\", (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6, arg7) => { let result = undefined; // code to be done on server which will return the result to RPC Client. ... return result; }, \"example.trace description\", \"example.trace help\"); ... }); To remove a method from the RPC Server Manager : rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_onready\", async () => { ... // Remove method from RPC Server let resultOfAdd = await rainbowSDK.rpcoverxmpp.removeRPCMethod(\"example.trace\"); ... }); RPC Client features Once started, you can use SDK has a RPC client. To call a method on the RPC Server and receiv the result of run you have to provide the methodName shared by the RPC Server, and an Array with the parameters use by the RPC method run. rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_onready\", async () => { ... // Build an Array of parameters for the RPC method on RPC Server. let rpcParams = []; let obj = { \"firstName\":\"Alice\", \"lastName\":\"Garner\", \"age\":20, \"isEmployed\":true, }; rpcParams.push(\"hello array of number and array of string\"); rpcParams.push([1,2,[\"arg1\", \"arg2\", {\"propertyOfObjInTab1\":\"mypropertyOfObjInTab1\", \"propertyOfObjInTab2\" : \"mypropertyOfObjInTab2\"}]]); rpcParams.push(\"param3\"); rpcParams.push(undefined); rpcParams.push(obj); rpcParams.push({\"propertyOne\":\"valueproperty\"}); rpcParams.push([\"valArrayOne\"]); let rpcoverxmppserver_jid=\"JID OF RPC Server BOT\"; // Warning : You need to spot on a resource, so the full jid must be used. // Request the run of the method on RPC Server let resultOfRpcMethodRun = await rainbowSDK.rpcoverxmpp.callRPCMethod(rpcoverxmppserver_jid,\"example.trace\", rpcParams); ... }); Last updated January, 26th 2018 On this pageManaging Remote Procedure Call over XMPPPreambleRPC ServerManage RPC ServiceRPC Client featuresWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

This guide describes how to configure the SDK for Node.JS for creating or inviting new users and updating their information. Roles and Rights Depending the right of the connected user, you can't or not manage users: RoleRightCan create usersDetails userNOCan't create or manage users adminsite_adminNOCan't create or manage users admincompany_adminYESWith this right, the SDK can create or invite new users in the company managed and update their information adminorganization_adminYESwith this right, the SDK can create or invite new users for all companies of the organization and update the users information Creating a new Rainbow user account A new Rainbow user account can be created in a company by calling the API createUserInCompany(). Basic user creation Creating a new user can be done like in the following code sample: let userEmailAccount = \"john.doe@myCompany.com\"; let userPassword = \"********\"; let userFirstname = \"John\"; let userLastname = \"Doe\"; rainbowSDK.admin.createUserInCompany(userEmailAccount, userPassword, userFirstname, userLastname).then((user) => { // Do something when the user has been created and added to that company ... }).catch((err) => { // Do something in case of error ... }); Once succeeded, the user John Doe is a new Rainbow user in the same company as the connected user. If you have the organization_admin right which means that you manage an organization (i.e. several companies), you have the right to create a user in one of the companies you manage by using the parameter companyId such as in the following: let userEmailAccount = \"john.doe@myCompany.com\"; let userPassword = \"********\"; let userFirstname = \"John\"; let userLastname = \"Doe\"; let companyId = \"5978e048f8abe8ad97357f06\"; // The target company rainbowSDK.admin.createUserInCompany(userEmailAccount, userPassword, userFirstname, userLastname, companyId,\"FR\", false, null).then((user) => { // Do something when the user has been created and added to that company ... }).catch((err) => { // Do something in case of error ... }); Once succeeded, the user John Doe is associated to the company specified by the parameter companyId. In all cases, this user account will have a user right and his language will be set by default to en-US. The end-user is not notified about the creation of the account so you have to contact him manually. Setting a user language If you want to set the language associated to the user, you can use the API createUserInCompany() with an extra parameter like in that sample: let userEmailAccount = \"jean.dupont@myCompany.com\"; let userPassword = \"********\"; let userFirstname = \"Jean\"; let userLastname = \"Dupont\"; let companyId = null; let language = \"fr-FR\"; rainbowSDK.admin.createUserInCompany(userEmailAccount, userPassword, userFirstname, userLastname, null, language, false, null).then((user) => { // Do something when the user has been created and added to that company ... }).catch((err) => { // Do something in case of error ... }); Language code follows the format ll-CC where ll is the language and CCis the culture name (using uppercase letter). Note: If the language used is managed by Rainbow clients, when connecting, the Rainbow graphical interface will be displayed in that language. Creating a new Rainbow guest account The SDK for Node.JS allows to create Rainbow Guest users. A Guest user is a Rainbow user With restricted rights: he can call only a limited subsets of API With a limited time-to-live (TTL): After a pre-defined period, the Guest user account is no more accessible (can't access to Rainbow) Without a real identity: Guest user have a fistname/lastname to be identified, but no real email and no other private data associated. So a Guest account can't be found using the search. Usage of Guest accounts Guest accounts can be used when you need to interact temporarily with a end-user and you don't need that this user creates a real Rainbow user. An example could be when a end-user visits you web site and wants to discuss with someone (in chat, audio or video). In that case, you will not create a new Rainbow account because in one hand the user is not identified and in the other hand, once the conversation is finished, the user will quit the website and perhaps never comes again. Guest accounts have a TTL (time to live). Once expired, these accounts cannot connect to Rainbow anymore (requests of service will fail). Basic creation For creating a new Guest user account, you need to have company_admin right and to call the API createGuestUser() like in the following sample: let guestFirstname = \"Jean\"; let guestLastname = \"Dupont\"; let language = \"en-US\"; let ttl = 86400 // active for"

This guide will describe in details how to configure the SDK for Node.JS for using a Proxy. Installation When you are behind a proxy, you need to configure NPM in order to go throught this proxy. A lot of documentation exists on the web to explain how to do it. Here is a link: Node.js and NPM behind a proxy Configuration Connecting using a Proxy If you need to access to Rainbow through an HTTP Proxy, you have to add the following part to your options configuration parameter: ... proxy: { host: '192.168.0.254', port: 8080, // Default to 80 if not provided protocol: 'http' // Default to 'http' if not provided } You need to specify the following parameters: host: The Proxy host (String) port: The proxy port (Integer) protocol: The protocol used (String), can be http or https. user: The proxy user (String) password: The proxy password (String) secureProtocol: \"SSLv3_method\" : The parameter to enable the SSL V3. Note: if the user/password are not need by proxy you can remove it from options provided to Rainbow Node Sdk. You can also provide a \"\" value for user/password. Here is an example of a complete configuration that uses an HTTP Proxy. // Define your configuration let options = { \"rainbow\": { \"host\": \"sandbox\", }, \"credentials\": { \"login\": \"bot@mycompany.com\", \"password\": \"thePassword!123\" }, \"application\": { \"appID\": \"\", \"appSecret\": \"\", }, // Logs options \"logs\": { \"enableConsoleLogs\": true, // Default: true \"enableFileLogs\": false, // Default: false \"file\": { \"path\": '/var/tmp/rainbowsdk/', // Default path used \"level\": 'debug' // Default log level used } }, ProxyImpl \"proxy\": { \"host\": '192.168.0.254', \"port\": 8080, \"protocol\": 'http', \"user\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, // IM options \"im\": { \"sendReadReceipt\": true // True to send the the 'read' receipt automatically } }; Connecting without a Proxy If you don't want to use a Proxy, the recommandation is to remove the key proxy from the configuration or to set the value of the host to an empty string \"\".

    "content": "DocumentationRetrieving calls historyLTS release 2.XPublished on 2025-01-01Retrieving calls history In this tutorial, you will discover how to retrieve your call history. Each time you call a Rainbow user using audio or video from your mobile application, your browser or when you call someone using your phone connected to a PBX, a call log entry is generated and added to your call history. This tutorial will help you understand how to deal with these information and manage your call history. Preamble The call history is not limited to audio and video calls done from Rainbow. Each time someone calls you on your phone associated to your Rainbow user or when you call someone with your phone device registered on Rainbow, a call log entry is generated and saved on Rainbow. The call history of the connected user will contain all these call log items. Each entry will contain the following structure: CallLog { id: '16E845E7384#84#1354', contact: Contact { id: '23032', // User ID or phone number _displayName: '23032 SingleClient', name: [Object], displayNameMD5: '13221569116aaad0a74fe708bbc50116', companyName: '', loginEmail: 'noEmail', ... }, state: 'missed', // Or `missed` duration: 0, // 0 for missed call direction: 'incoming', // Or `outgoing` callSubject: '', isLatestCall: undefined, type: 'telephone', // or `webrtc` read: true, // false if new (not marked as read) date: 2019-11-19T15:53:30.338Z, count: 1, editable: true, isMissed: true } Here are some information regarding the parameters in that structure: Regarding the property contact, if the recipient is a Rainbow user, this property will contain a Contact object identified by the ID information. If the recipient is not a Rainbow user, you can have only a phone number. Regarding the property read. Its value equals to false if it is a new entry that has not been marked as read. Regarding the property state. Its value equals to answered if the call has been established or would be set to missed otherwise. Regarding the property type. Its value equals to webrtc if the call has been done with the computer or the mobile using the WebRTC technology or telephone otherwise (for a PSTN call). Regarding the property direction. Its value equals to incoming when this is a call from a recipient to the connected user or outgoing when the call has been established by the connected user. Retrieving the call history Once the SDK for Web has started, you can retrieve the log history of the connected user by using the API rainbowSDK.calllog.getAll(). This operation is not synchronous so to be sure that all the history has been received, you need to listen to the event rainbow_oncalllogupdated. Here is an example for retrieving the call history when started: rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_oncalllogupdated\", (calllogs) => { logger.log(\"debug\", \"(rainbow_oncalllogupdated) - rainbow event received. \"); if (calllogs) { if (calllogs.callLogs) { logger.log(\"debug\", \"(rainbow_oncalllogupdated) - calllogs.callLogs.length : \", calllogs.callLogs.length); calllogs.orderByDateCallLogs.forEach((callL) => { logger.log(\"debug\", \"(rainbow_oncalllogupdated) - one call logged in calllogs.orderByDateCallLogs : \", callL); }); } } else { logger.log(\"error\", \"(rainbow_oncalllogupdated) - rainbow event received. empty calllogs\", calllogs); } }); The API rainbowSDK.calllog.isInitialized() can be used to check if the initial log history has been retrieved from Rainbow. A true value returned means that the whole call log has been retrieved from Rainbow. Listening to new call history entry The same listener on rainbow_oncalllogupdated can be used to listen to new call log entry. This new entry will be automatically added to the history. Calling the API Managing call history counter Generally speaking, when a call is missed a new call log entry is added to the history with the property read equals to false. So, when you need to know how many calls you missed, you can use the API rainbowSDK.calllog.getMissedCallLogCounter() such as in the following: let missedCallCounter = rainbowSDK.calllog.getMissedCallLogCounter(); The variable missedCallCounter will be a number that represents the number of missed calls. And then, using the API rainbowSDK.calllog.getAll(), you will be able to retrieve these calls. In order to decrease this counter, you will have to mark these logs 'as read' (described in the next paragraph). Mark a call history entry as read To mark as read an existing missed call entry, you need to call the API rainbowSDK.calllog.markCallLogAsRead(). rainbowSDK.events.on(\"rainbow_oncalllogackupdated\", (calllogs) => { logger.log(\"debug\", \"(rainbow_oncalllogackupdated) - rainbow event received. \"); if (calllogs) { if (calllogs.callLogs) { logger.log(\"debug\", \"(rainbow_oncalllogackupdated) - rainbow event received. calllogs.callLogs.length\", calllogs.callLogs.length); //Do something when an acknowledgement has been done on the call history } } }); let entry = rainbowSDK.calllog.getAll()[0]; rainbowSDK.ca"

This tutorial will explain how to use the FileStorage service for sharing files in Rainbow. Preamble All files shared with others Rainbow users are stored on Rainbow until you decide to remove it. To avoid bad usage and depending your profile, you have some limits.

Sharing a file with a Rainbow user When in a conversation with a Rainbow user, you can share a file by calling the API uploadFileToConversation() like in the following example let contactIdToSearch = \"...\"; let fileInfos = {}; fileInfos.path = \"./path/to/my/file\"; fileInfos.size = \"SizeInOctets\"; fileInfos.type = \"MimeType\"; fileInfos.name = \"filename\"; // Retrieve a contact by its id rainbowSDK.contacts.getContactById(contactIdToSearch) .then(function(contact) { // Retrieve the associated conversation return rainbowSDK.conversations.openConversationForContact(contact); }).then(function(conversation) { // Share the file return rainbowSDK.fileStorage.uploadFileToConversation(conversation, fileInfos, \"My message \"); }).then(function(message) { // Do something once the file has been shared ... }).catch(function(err) { // Do somehting in case of error ... }); The API uploadFileToConversation() takes an Object describing the file. Sharing a file within a Bubble Sharing a file within a Bubble can be done as simply as with a contact by calling the API uploadFileToBubble(). let bubbleId = \"...\"; let fileInfos = {}; fileInfos.path = \"./path/to/my/file\"; fileInfos.size = \"SizeInOctets\"; fileInfos.type = \"MimeType\"; fileInfos.name = \"filename\"; // Retrieve the bubble let bubble = rainbowSDK.bubbles.getBubbleById(bubbleId); // Upload the file rainbowSDK.fileStorage.uploadFileToBubble(bubble, fileInfos, \"My message \") .then(function(message) { // Do something once the file has been shared ... }).catch(function(err) { // Do somehting in case of error ... }); Be notified of a new file shared When you share a file, you will get in return an event rainbow_onfilecreated which contains the fileid of the file shared: { \"fileid\": \"5bbdfde45a0b44c0c08bfa2d\" } When you updates an already shared file, you will get in return an event rainbow_onfileupdated which contains the fileid of the file shared updated: { \"fileid\": \"5bbdfde45a0b44c0c08bfa2d\" } When you delete a file, you will get in return an event rainbow_onfiledeleted which contains the fileid of the file deleted: { \"fileid\": \"5bbdfde45a0b44c0c08bfa2d\" } Downloading a file or for an image, put it in IMG Tag Files are protected in Rainbow. If you want to download a file, you need to be signed and to call the API downloadFile() like in the following code // Retrieve a list of files own by the current logged in user rainbowSDK.fileStorage.retrieveFileDescriptorsListPerOwner().then((fileDescriptorsReceived) => { // iter over the list of file for (let fileReceived of fileDescriptorsReceived) { // Download the current file rainbowSDK.fileStorage.downloadFile(fileReceived).then((file) => { // Write the downloaded file to OS filesystem if (file ) { try { let blobArray = file.buffer; let writeStream = createWriteStream(\"c:\\\\temp\\\\\" + fileReceived.fileName); writeStream.on('error', () => { console.log(\"WriteStream error event\"); }); writeStream.on('drain', () => { console.log(\"WriteStream drain event\"); }); for (let index = 0; index < blobArray.length; index++) { if (blobArray[index]) { console.log(\"writeAvailableChunksInDisk : Blob \" + index + \" available\"); //fileReceived.chunkWrittenInDisk = index; writeStream.write(new Buffer(blobArray[index])); blobArray[index"

There are severals type of calls : - 3PCC calls done with a PBX linked to rainbow. - Conference calls done in a bubble. - Webrtc calls done with rainbow officials UI (Android/Ipad/Desktop/Web). Note that it can not be done by node SDK. Only events are available. 3PCC Events calls Rainbow Telephony is heavily dependent on the events received by the connected users. There are two main types of 3PCC telephony events: those informing about the system changes (i.e. telephony started or nomadic state changed) and those being activated during a call. First category of events include: rainbow_ontelephonystatuschanged - Fired when status of the telephony service event is received. rainbow_onnomadicstatusevent - informing about the Nomadic Event rainbow_onvoicemessageupdated - Fired when a voice message updated event is received Whereas the events activated during a call include: rainbow_oncallupdated - Fired during a pure 3PCC telephony call rainbow_oncallforwarded - Fired when the forward state changes or by request (getForwardStatus) rainbow_onconferenced - Fired when a pure 3PCC telephony call is conferenced. rainbow_oncallupdated event sequence This event is fired when the connected user's has a call on his 3PCC phoneset.

    "content": "DocumentationAuth ServiceAuthentication Services Overview The AuthService class provides methods for handling authentication-related tasks within the Rainbow SDK. This includes user login, password management, and configuration setup. The service leverages native modules to interact with the underlying authentication mechanisms. Methods login(email: string, password: string): void - Initiates the login process using the provided email and password. Parameters email: string - The email address of the user. password: string - The password of the user. silentLogin(): void - Attempts to log in the user without displaying any UI. This can be useful for automatic login scenarios. signOut(): void - Logs out the current user by disconnecting them from the Rainbow SDK and clearing their credentials. resetUserPassword(temporaryCode: string, newPassword: string): void - Resets the user's password using a temporary code received via email. Parameters temporaryCode: string - The temporary code sent to the user for verification. newPassword: string - The new password to set for the user. sendResetPasswordEmail(email: string): void - Sends a password reset email to the specified email address. Parameters email: string - The email address of the user. Usage Example import { authService } from 'path-to-auth-service'; // Logging in a user authService.login('user@example.com', 'password123'); // Sending a password reset email authService.sendResetPasswordEmail('user@example.com'); // Resetting a user's password authService.resetUserPassword('temporaryCode', 'newPassword123'); Conclusion The AuthService class provides essential methods for managing user authentication within the Rainbow SDK. By utilizing these methods, developers can easily implement authentication flows in their applications.

    "content": "DocumentationuseRainbowAuthuseRainbowAuth Hook Overview The useRainbowAuth hook is a custom hook that provides an easy way to access the authentication state and user information from the Redux store within your React components. This hook simplifies the process of checking if a user is authenticated and retrieving the user's details. Usage To use the useRainbowAuth hook, simply import it into your component and call it. The hook will return an object containing the authentication status and user information. import React from 'react'; import { useRainbowAuth } from 'path-to-hooks'; const UserProfile: React.FC = () => { const { isAuthenticated, user } = useRainbowAuth(); return ( <div> {isAuthenticated ? ( <h1>Welcome, {user?.name}!</h1> ) : ( <h1>Please log in.</h1> )} </div> ); }; Return Value The useRainbowAuth hook returns an object with the following properties: isAuthenticated: A boolean indicating whether the user is authenticated. user: An object containing information about the user, including their name, email, and other details. Error Handling he hook includes error handling to ensure that it can still function correctly even when used outside of the Redux Provider. If the hook is called outside of the provider context, it falls back to accessing the Redux store directly to retrieve the user state. Conclusion The useRainbowAuth hook is a powerful utility for managing authentication state in your React components. By using this hook, you can easily check if a user is authenticated and access their details, streamlining the process of building authentication flows in your application.

This SDK provides a headless authentication provider, giving you full control over your application's UI and navigation flow. The RainbowProvider Component The RainbowProvider is the core component for integrating Rainbow services. It sets up the necessary Redux store, theme, and authentication context for the SDK to function. It does not render any UI itself. To use it, wrap your application's root component with RainbowProvider: // App.tsx import React from 'react'; import { RainbowProvider } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'; import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native'; import RootNavigator from './RootNavigator'; // Your app's navigator const App = () => { return ( <RainbowProvider> <NavigationContainer> <RootNavigator /> </NavigationContainer> </RainbowProvider> ); }; export default App; The useRainbowAuth Hook To manage the authentication state in your application, the SDK provides the useRainbowAuth hook. This hook gives you access to the user's authentication status, loading state, and user information. The hook returns an object with the following properties: isAuthenticated (boolean): true if the user is logged in, otherwise false. isLoading (boolean): true during the initial authentication check (e.g., silent login). user (IUser): The connected user's information if authenticated, otherwise null. Building Your Authentication Flow With RainbowProvider and useRainbowAuth, you can create a custom authentication flow that fits your application's design. You are responsible for building all the UI components for login, registration, password reset, etc. Here is an example of a RootNavigator that uses the useRainbowAuth hook to conditionally render the authentication screens or the main application screens: // RootNavigator.tsx import React from 'react'; import { useRainbowAuth, Spinner } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'; import AuthNavigator from './AuthNavigator'; // Your authentication screens import MainAppNavigator from './MainAppNavigator'; // Your main app screens const RootNavigator = () => { const { isAuthenticated, isLoading } = useRainbowAuth(); if (isLoading) { // Show a loading indicator during the initial auth check return <Spinner spinnerSize={40} />; } return isAuthenticated ? <MainAppNavigator /> : <AuthNavigator />; }; export default RootNavigator; NOTE: You can find a complete implementation of this approach in the example project provided in the SDK repository example link On this pageConnecting to Rainbow & AuthenticationPreambleThe RainbowProvider ComponentThe useRainbowAuth HookBuilding Your Authentication FlowWas this content helpful to you?YesNoFeedback© Copyright - 2022 | ALE InternationalCPaaS SDK for business communication solutions | Rainbow v2.31.0ProductsWebNodeAndroidiOSReact NativeCSharpAPIsUseful linksDocumentationStoreSupportPricingHomeExploreLegal informationsServices AgreementDeveloper AgreementCookie policyThird party softwareCompanyPartnerVisit usRainbowContact usFollow us on"

    "content": "DocumentationEnabling push notificationsEnabling push notifications When your application needs to receive notification at any time, you have to implement push notifications. There are few steps you have to do it in iOS/Android app to handle the notification Android setup Step 1 - Set up firebase cloud messaging he first step is setting up the Firebase Cloud Messaging feature. You must follow this Firebase tutorial. At the end of this step, your project should be configured with a google-services.json (in app directory) and all required dependencies. Step 2 - Access the device registration token Create a new service class which extends FirebaseMessagingService and override onNewToken() method to send the token to the Rainbow SDK. In the RN SDk we provided a notificationHandler interface, that handle accessing the registration token and send the received messages to Rainbow SDK. So first you need pass your app context to the notificationHandler class, as on sample code below. all you have to do is calling the onTokenRefresh() to send the refresh token and call onPushMessageReceived() to send the received message [see step 3]. import com.ale.rainbow.rn.notifications.INotificationHandler; import com.ale.rainbow.rn.notifications.NotificationHandler; public class MyNotificationPushService extends FirebaseMessagingService { @Override public void onCreate() { super.onCreate(); notificationHandler = new NotificationHandler(this); } @Override public void onNewToken(String token) { notificationHandler.onTokenRefresh(refreshedToken); } } Declare the service in your app's manifest: <service android:name=\".MyNotificationPushService\"> <intent-filter> <action android:name=\"com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT\"/> </intent-filter> </service Step 3 - Handle Messages In your MyNotificationPushService service class, override onMessageReceived() and call to send received message to the Rainbow SDK. public class MyFirebaseMessagingService extends FirebaseMessagingService { @Override public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) { notificationHandler.onPushMessageReceived(remoteMessage, this.getApplication(), MainActivity.Class); super.onMessageReceived(message); } } Step 4 - Set the firebase service key to Rainbow Hub In order to have Rainbow handling push notification, you have to upload the Firebase server key of your application Firebase project to your Rainbow application on the Rainbow hub. 1 - Get the server key on the Firebase site: Go to the Firebase console, click on your project and copy the server key. . 2 - Rainbow hub: Set the server key for Android. Go to the Rainbow hub and set the server key for your Android application. iOS Setup Step 1 - CREATING IOS CERTIFICATES and ENABLE PUSH WITH RAINBOW SDK Please follow this instruction in this link push notification setup. Step 2 - For react-native-rainbow-module >= 1.1.0 Because in this version the remote notification message was encrypted, you need to decrypted by following those steps: add notification services extensions to you project: Select File > New > Target in Xcode > Select the Notification Service Extension target from the iOS > Application section. specify a name for your extension. open Podfile and add the following: target 'YOUR_NOTIFICATION_EXTENSION_NAME' do pod 'react-native-rainbow-module', :path => '../..' end ... target 'YOUR_APP_NAME' do ... then make pod install command. open NotificationService, add the following code: `` import \"NotificationService.h\" import <RNRainbowRn.h> //<--- add this @interface NotificationService () @property (nonatomic, strong) void (^contentHandler)(UNNotificationContent contentToDeliver); @property (nonatomic, strong) UNMutableNotificationContentbestAttemptContent; @end @implementation NotificationService (void)didReceiveNotificationRequest:(UNNotificationRequest )request withContentHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContent _Nonnull))contentHandler { self.contentHandler = contentHandler; self.bestAttemptContent = [request.content mutableCopy]; // Add this following to your file.

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedGetting Started Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow React Native Software Development Kit (SDK)! Preamble The Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (ALE) Rainbow SDK is a React Native library that allows you to connect your native Android and iOS applications to the Rainbow platform. This guide will walk you through setting up your environment and installing the SDK in a modern React Native project. Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured for React Native development: Node.js: Active LTS version recommended. npm or yarn(preferred). React Native CLI. Xcode for iOS development. Android Studio for Android development. For a detailed guide on setting up your development environment, please follow the official React Native documentation. Installation Adding the Rainbow SDK to your project is straightforward. In your React Native project's root directory, run: # Using npm npm install react-native-rainbow-module # Or using yarn yarn add react-native-rainbow-module iOS Installation For iOS, you need to install the native dependencies (Pods): cd ios && pod install Peer Dependencies To function correctly, the Rainbow SDK requires several peer dependencies to be installed in your project. These are libraries that the SDK depends on but does not bundle, giving you greater control over your app's dependency tree. You will need to install the following packages: # Using npm npm install react-native-localize react-native-permissions react-native-vector-icons react-native-keyboard-controller # Or using yarn yarn add react-native-localize react-native-permissions react-native-vector-icons react-native-keyboard-controller After installing, you will need to configure them for each platform. Credential Storage The Rainbow SDK does not handle the storage of user credentials (e.g., email and password). This is the responsibility of the consuming application. We recommend using a secure storage solution like react-native-keychain to store credentials. You will need to install and configure it in your application, then use it to save credentials on successful login and load them for silent login. For an example of how to implement this, please see the LoginForm.tsx and ForgotPassword.tsx components in the example application. iOS Installation For iOS, you need to install the native dependencies (Pods): cd ios && pod install Android Installation For Android, React Native's autolinking feature will handle most of the setup. However, you need to perform the following configuration steps. Android Configuration 1. Set Minimum SDK Version The Rainbow SDK requires a minimum Android SDK version of 26. Open your project's android/app/build.gradle file and set minSdkVersion. // android/app/build.gradle android { defaultConfig { ... minSdkVersion 26 } ... } 2. Add the Rainbow Maven Repository In your project's root android/build.gradle file, add the Open Rainbow maven repository: // android/build.gradle allprojects { repositories { ... maven { url \"http://maven.openrainbow.io\" } } } 3. Initialize the SDK in MainApplication This is a critical step. You must initialize the Rainbow SDK in your MainApplication file before the React Native application starts. This is done by calling RainbowPackage.setApplication() in the onCreate method. For Kotlin (MainApplication.kt): import com.ale.rainbow.rn.RainbowPackage class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication { // ... other code override fun onCreate() { super.onCreate() RainbowPackage.setApplication(this, MainActivity::class.java) SoLoader.init(this, false) // ... other code } } For Java (MainApplication.java): import com.ale.rainbow.rn.RainbowPackage; public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication { // ... other code @Override public void onCreate() { super.onCreate(); RainbowPackage.setApplication(this, MainActivity.class); SoLoader.init(this, /* native exopackage */ false); // ... other code } } // android/build.gradle allprojects { repositories { ... maven { url \"http://maven.openrainbow.io\" } } } Initialize the SDK STEP 1 : Create a Rainbow application To initialize the SDK you need an applicationID and a secretKey from the Rainbow Developer Hub. This information allows you to identify your application and allows you to use the Rainbow platform. For more information, see Applications lifecycle which explains what is the purpose, how to create an application, and how to get the application ID and the secret key. STEP 2 : Add Configuration File The Rainbow SDK now uses a platform-specific configuration file for initialization. You need to add a rainbow-config.json file in both iOS and Android projects: Configuration File Structure Your rainbow-config.json should have the following structure: [ { \"HOST\":\"openrainbow.com\", \"APP_ID\":\"your app id for .com host\", \"SEC_KEY\":\"your secret key\" }, { \"HOST\":\"openrainbow.net\", \"APP_ID\":\"your app id for .net host\", \"SEC_KEY\":\"your secret key\" }"

    "content": "DocumentationListen for eventsListening to SDK Events Overview The Rainbow SDK for React Native uses an event-driven architecture to notify your application about various state changes and updates. This guide explains how to listen and respond to these events in your application. Table of Contents Introduction to Event System Common Event Patterns Event Categories Connection Events Contact Events Call Events Message Events Bubble Events Best Practices Introduction to Event System The SDK's event system allows your application to react to changes in real-time. All events are emitted through the eventEmitter instance, which you can import from the SDK: import { eventEmitter, EventType } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'; // Subscribe to an event const subscription = eventEmitter.addListener( EventType.ContactsUpdated, (contacts: IContact[]) => { console.log('Contacts updated:', contacts); } ); // Don't forget to clean up // Usually in a useEffect cleanup function subscription.remove(); Common Event Patterns Basic Event Subscription useEffect(() => { const subscription = eventEmitter.addListener( EventType.ContactsUpdated, (contacts: IContact[]) => { // Handle updated contacts } ); return () => { // Clean up the subscription subscription.remove(); }; }, []); Multiple Event Subscriptions useEffect(() => { const subscriptions = [ eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.ContactsUpdated, handleContactsUpdate), eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.MessagesUpdated, handleMessagesUpdate), ]; return () => { subscriptions.forEach(sub => sub.remove()); }; }, []); Event Categories Connection Events EventTypeDescription IsNetworkAvailablebooleanFires when network connectivity changes ConnectionStateChangedConnectionStateFires when the connection state changes eventEmitter.addListener( EventType.IsNetworkAvailable, (isAvailable: boolean) => { console.log('Network available:', isAvailable); } ); Contact Events EventTypeDescription ContactsUpdatedIContact[]Fires when the contact list is updated PresenceChanged{ jid: string, presence: string }Fires when a contact's presence changes Call Events EventTypeDescription CallStateChangedCallStateFires when call state changes CallAddedICallFires when a new call is received CallRemovedstringFires when a call ends (callId) Message Events EventTypeDescription MessagesUpdatedIMessage[]Fires when messages are updated IsTyping{ jid: string, isTyping: boolean }Fires when typing status changes Bubble Events EventTypeDescription BubblesListUpdatedIBubble[]Fires when the bubble list is updated OnBubbleUpdatedIBubbleFires when a bubble is updated Best Practices Always Clean Up Remove event listeners when components unmount to prevent memory leaks. Use TypeScript Types Always type your event handlers to get better IDE support and catch errors early. Debounce Rapid Events Some events might fire rapidly (like typing indicators). Consider debouncing the handler if needed. Error Handling Always handle potential errors in your event handlers. Performance For events that might cause expensive re-renders, consider using useCallback for your handlers. Complete Example import React, { useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'; import { eventEmitter, EventType, IContact } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'; const MyComponent = () => { const handleContactsUpdate = useCallback((contacts: IContact[]) => { console.log('Contacts updated:', contacts); // Update your component state or perform other actions }, []); useEffect(() => { const subscriptions = [ eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.ContactsUpdated, handleContactsUpdate), eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.IsNetworkAvailable, (isAvailable) => { console.log('Network status:', isAvailable ? 'Online' : 'Offline'); }) ]; return () => { subscriptions.forEach(sub => sub.remove()); }; }, [handleContactsUpdate]); return ( // Your component JSX ); }; export default MyComponent; For a complete list of all available events and their types, please refer to the Events API Reference.

Preamble This is the same mechanism for Peer to Peer messages and messages bubbles. All you need to do is import the <Messages /> from the Rainbow RN library as below , Then you will be able to make use of the Following chat feature: Send Message: you can send a new message to another peer to peer or a bubble chat. Load more messages. Reply to a Message: you can reply to a specific message in the chat. listen to the message changes including: EventType.MessagesUpdated, EventType.IsTyping, EventType.FileAttachFinished, EventType.FileDownloadFinished. incase you wanna handle more feature than the default, we already support all the message services that you need, with the customized message props as the following table. Available props #NameTypeDescription 1conversationIPeerthe peer object its could be a conversation type [P2P] or bubble type 2messagesIMessage[]the message list for the the selected peer 3styleViewStylethe container style of the message component 4onMessageLongPressed(context: any, message: IMessage) => void[optional] callback method when long pressed accuses on a message 5renderSendingExtraView() => React.ReactNode[optional] the extra view above the sending view 6renderChatActions() => React.ReactNode[optional] the customized action you wanna add beside the sending action 7renderMessageCustomView(currentMessage: IMessage) => React.ReactNode[optional] Custom view inside the message bubble 8renderSystemMessage(currentMessage: IMessage) => React.ReactNode[optional] the message comes from the system, for example 'Call Ended' ...etc 9onSend(message: IMessage) => void[optional] A callback method when the send button is pressed 10alwaysShowSendboolean[optional] showing the sending button or not? where it's set by default to true 11renderMessageImage(currentMessage: IMessage) => void[optional] customized message image 12renderAvatar(currentMessage: IMessage) => React.ReactNode[optional] customized user avatar inside the messages view 13onInputTextChanged(text: string) => void[optional] callback in case there is changes occurs in the sending text input 13renderSendButton(sendProps: SendProps) => React.ReactNode[optional] function to customize the \"Send\" text button with an icon or any react element to send messages.

    "content": "DocumentationManage InvitationsManaging Invitations Overview The Rainbow SDK allows you to manage social invitations, which are the primary way users connect and build their network. This feature is essential for creating a collaborative and interactive experience in your application. Core Functionalities The invitation system is built around a few key concepts: Fetching Invitations: You can retrieve lists of both sent and received invitations for the logged-in user. Responding to Received Invitations: When a user receives an invitation from another person, your application can allow them to either accept it, adding the person to their contacts, or decline it. Managing Sent Invitations: For invitations the user has sent, they can choose to cancel the invitation before it's accepted or resend it if needed. Custom UI Components: The SDK provides flexible UI components to display and manage invitations in your app's interface. How It Works Like other features in the SDK, the invitation system is asynchronous. You will dispatch an action (like accepting an invitation) and then listen for events to know when the action is complete and to receive updated lists of invitations. This ensures your app's UI stays fast and responsive. UI Components InvitationCard Component The InvitationCard is a flexible UI component that displays a single invitation with appropriate actions based on the invitation type (received or sent). It's perfect for when you need more control over the invitation UI than what the BubbleInvitations component provides. Props PropTypeRequiredDescription invitationIInvitationYesThe invitation object to display onAccept(invitation: IInvitation) => voidNoCallback when the accept button is pressed (for received invitations) onDecline(invitation: IInvitation) => voidNoCallback when the decline button is pressed (for received invitations) onCancel(invitation: IInvitation) => voidNoCallback when the cancel button is pressed (for sent invitations) onResend(invitation: IInvitation) => voidNoCallback when the resend button is pressed (for sent invitations) Example Usage import { InvitationCard } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'; const InvitationList = ({ invitations, onAccept, onDecline, onCancel, onResend }) => { return ( <FlatList data={invitations} keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} renderItem={({ invitation }) => ( <InvitationCard invitation={invitation} onAccept={ onAccept(invitation)} onDecline={onDecline(invitation)} onCancel={onCancel(invitation)} onResend={onResend(invitation)} /> )} /> ); }; BubbleInvitations Component For a complete out-of-the-box solution for managing bubble invitations, you can use the BubbleInvitations component.

Rainbow conceptDetails A peerA peer is a participant of a call in a peer-to-peer call or in a conference call. WebRTC Peer to Peer CallThis is a call between two users[caller and the callee or the recipient. An audio only CallAn audio only call uses only the microphone for dispatching the audio to the recipient An Video callA video call uses the camera for dispatching both audio and video legs to the recipient A sharing callA sharing call uses the screen or an application for dispatching a data leg to the recipient. The call can be initiated with or without an audio leg. The audio leg can be added during the call. Escalate to video callWhen in an audio call, you can decide at any time to add a video leg with your recipients Lock conference callwhen you initiate a conference call you can lock it to prevent other participant from joining the call. Check lock conferences section Delegate Conference CallThe initiator of the conference call can delegate the control to another attendee then leave the conference.

First you need to setup the app permission: SET-UP THE APPLICATION AUTHORIZATIONS. Then you need to setup the VOIP certificate: VoIP Services Certificate. Register Call App Before building any of the Call components, you have to register the callApp when your app starts inside index.js. And inside the callApp you can use any call component you want to support whatever its a P2P Call, Conference Call, or PBX Call. And the purpose of separate the CallApp from all other app components because we wanna make sure that when the call is active there is No other component that can interfere with the call.

And you need to listen for fetching the files result by using EventType.GetAllSharedFileWithPeerResult event. After you successfully got the shared files array you need to import the <SharedFiles ..props /> from the RN sdk npm package and pass some requited props as explained above in the table. The SharedFils component will render the files list you share through the provided peer(conversation or bubble) using a RecyclerListView. if you want to customize the files list or you want to use another list view you can call the optional method renderFilesItems().

    "content": "DocumentationGetting startedGetting started Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow Software S2S Starterkit (Rainbow-S2S-StarterKit-NodeJS) for NodeJS and other languages. The Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (ALE) Rainbow Software Rainbow-S2S-StarterKit-NodeJS is a nodejs tool provided to help user building server backend applications (bot, agents) based on Rainbow S2S API modules to interact with Rainbow server system without directly implementing the underlaying REST protocol and callback notifications mechanism. This starter guide will help you : Understand Rainbow S2S API Setup Rainbow-S2S-StarterKit-NodeJS in a linux server environnement (for other environnements,the tools used here are the same, you will have to refer to installation process for your OS) Subscribe to Rainbow server callback notifications and build your own server application in your chosen language. Prerequisites To use the Rainbow-S2S-StarterKit-NodeJS you need an applicationID and a secretKey from the openrainbow hub. These information allow you to identify your application and allow you to use the Rainbow platform. For more information, see Applications lifecycle which explains what is the purpose, how to create an application and how to get the application ID and the secret key. The hostname is also necessary to know which server is used: the sandbox or the production server. As Rainbow-S2S-StarterKit-NodeJS is intended to be used on a server it is recommended to have a Linux OS with those minimum components installed : NodeJS (see https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for other OS) npm package manager (see https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm for other OS) @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli (node component) (as an npm package the installation is the same for all OS https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/) It is also recommened to have a minimum knowledge on OAS standard (Open API Specification). What are S2S API modules used in Rainbow-S2S-StarterKit-NodeJS Rainbow S2S module are based on REST APIs description over OpenAPI standard (via swagger files [openapi.yaml or openapi.json]) so user can generate client implementations in various languages and hide REST calls by manipulating objects. User can still make direct REST calls to Rainbow S2S platform, and implement callbacks events over webhook (web server that will received POST events messages from Rainbow system) but it's not recommended. Rainbow-S2S-StarterKit-NodeJS uses S2S generated nodejs API from S2S swagger definition and provides chat and presence communication features between server side program and Rainbow system. Rainbow OpenAPI Specifications files (swagger files) Rainbow server exposes various RESTfull enpoints to help users intergrating communication features in their own applications. Those RESTfull API endpoints are described in OAS swagger definition files. OAS specificationsDescription Rainbow Authentication PortalAuthentication API S2S PortalServer to server API. For the moment it is essentially used for Instant messaging communication. Each swagger file can be used to generate client APIs that hide all REST protocol and data consistency check. Rainbow-S2S-StarterKit-NodeJS composition S2S NodeJS StarterKit implements S2S client APIs in NodeJS to interact with Rainbow and a local REST server (to handle webhook events via callback url). Rainbow acts as a client for the REST server (by POSTING events data on a public endpoint defined by the callbak url). Configuration file Configuration fileDescription rainbow-s2s-starterkit-nodejs/config/StarterKitConfig.json.samplestarter kit main configuration file (to rename .json and update according to your Rainbow registration params). It defines bot credentials, localhost server settings. Rainbow-S2S-Starterkit-NodeJS configuration file is used to configure 6 main entities.
