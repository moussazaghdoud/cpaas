Supported Browsers

LTS release 4.0.0Publiée le 2022-12-21

## Supported Browsers

Rainbow Web SDK is supported on all the major browser engines:

-   **Google Chrome** and Chromium-based browsers like **Opera**, **Brave**, **Edge** (version 56 and higher)
-   **Firefox** (version 58 and higher)
-   **Edge** (non-chromium, version 15 and higher)

It is strongly recommended to update the browser version to the latest official release. Rainbow team provides support for most of the SDK features. It is best, though, to update to the latest Firefox and Chromium-based browser versions in order to ensure full WebRTC support.
