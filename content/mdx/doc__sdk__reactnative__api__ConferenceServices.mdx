Conference Service

### Conference Services

---

### Preamble

---

The conference services module `conferenceService` has all the methods supported by this library.

### Start Conference Call

---

You can initiate the conference call by calling `conferenceService.startConference(bubbleId: string)` in the bubble if and only if:

-   you have the conference privilege into your account.
-   your login user must be either the bubble owner or organizer \[`moderator`\].

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const startConference = (bubbleId: string) => {
conferenceService.startConference(bubbleId);
}
```

`Please Note:` You can check the [Sample App](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-React-Native-Samples/blob/main/src/Messages/BubbleChatView.tsx) how we used the start conference call.

### Join Conference

---

Incase the login user have joinable conference \[active conference\], you can call `conferenceService.joinConference(bubbleId: string)`.

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const joinConference = (bubbleId: string) => {
conferenceService.joinConference(bubbleId);
}
...
```

`Please Note:` You can check the [Sample App](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-React-Native-Samples/blob/main/src/Messages/BubbleChatView.tsx) how we used the join conference call.

### End Conference Call

---

For ending the active conference call, you can call `conferenceService.endConferenceCall(bubbleId: string)`.

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const endConferenceCall = (bubbleId: string) => {
conferenceService.endConferenceCall(bubbleId);
}
...
```

`Please Note:` In the `Sample App` we used the `conferenceService.endConferenceCall` in the already built component for you `<EndConferenceCallButton call={call}/>` as shown in the following link [Conference](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-React-Native-Samples/blob/main/src/Calls/Conference/CustomizableConferenceView.tsx).

### Decline Conference Call

---

For decline the incoming conference call, you can call `conferenceService.declineCall(bubbleId: string)`. The difference between the `End Conference` and the `Decline Conference` is that `Decline` is used for the incoming call otherwise the `End Conference` is used.

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const declineConferenceCall = (bubbleId: string) => {
conferenceService.declineCall(bubbleId);
}
...
```

`Please Note:` In the `Sample App` we used the `conferenceService.declineCall` in the already built component for you `<EndConferenceCallButton call={call}/>` as shown in the following link [Conference](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-React-Native-Samples/blob/main/src/Calls/Conference/CustomizableConferenceView.tsx).

### Add Video To Conference

---

To add a local video to the active conference , you can call `conferenceService.addVideoToConference`

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const addVideoToConference = () => {
conferenceService.addVideoToConference();
}
...
```

`Please Note:` In the `Sample App` we used the `conferenceService.addVideoToConference` in the already built component for you `<AddVideoToConfButton call={call} />` as shown in the following link [Conference](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-React-Native-Samples/blob/main/src/Calls/Conference/CustomizableConferenceView.tsx).

### Remove Video From Conference

---

To remove the local video from the active conference , you can call `conferenceService.removeVideoFromConference`

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const removeVideoFromConference = () => {
conferenceService.removeVideoFromConference();
}
...
```

`Please Note:` In the `Sample App` we used the `conferenceService.addVideoToConference` in the already built component for you `<AddVideoToConfButton call={call} />` as shown in the following link [Conference](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-React-Native-Samples/blob/main/src/Calls/Conference/CustomizableConferenceView.tsx).

### Mute All Participants

---

To mute all the attendees in the active conference , you can call `conferenceService.muteAllParticipants(bubbleId: string)`

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const muteAllParticipants = (bubbleId: string) => {
conferenceService.muteAllParticipants(bubbleId);
}
...
```

### Un Mute All Participants

---

To un mute all the attendees in the active conference , you can call `conferenceService.unMuteAllParticipants(bubbleId: string)`

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const unMuteAllParticipants = (bubbleId: string) => {
conferenceService.unMuteAllParticipants(bubbleId);
}
...
```

### Delegate Conference

---

Incase you are the conference call initiator and you wanna to handle the conference call to another participant and leave the conference , you can call `conferenceService.delegateConference(conferenceRoomId: string, participantId: string)`

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const delegateConferenceCall = (bubbleId: string, participantId: string) => {
conferenceService.delegateConference(bubbleId, participantId);
}
...
```

### Lock Conference Call

---

In case you wanna lock the conference call were to prevent any participant to join the conference call, you can use this method `conferenceService.lockConference(conferenceRoomId: string)` to switch the Lock state (lock/unlock), and then you can listen to the lock state changes result `EventType.GetConferenceLockState`.

Please check the following example:

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module';

// Listen to the conference lock state event.
const conferenceLockState = eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.GetConferenceLockState, (eventData: boolean) => {
            console.log("conference lock state had changed to : ", eventData);
            ...
        });
        ...
// Switch conference lock state
const switchConferenceLock = (bubbleId: string) => {
    conferenceService.lockConference(bubbleId);
}
```

`Please Note:` In the `Sample App` we used the `conferenceService.lockConference` in the already built component for you `<LockConfButton call={call} />` as shown in the following link [Conference](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-React-Native-Samples/blob/main/src/Calls/Conference/CustomizableConferenceView.tsx).

### Check Conference Availability

---

You can check the conference availability by calling `conferenceService.CheckConferenceAvailability(bubbleId: string)`, and the result will fired the `EventType.ConferenceCapability` with boolean event data.

Incase conference availability data result is `true` this mean the following:

-   you have the conference privilege and he is either the owner or organizer.
-   you have an active conference in this bubble, which mean you can join it, but its not necessarily have a conference privilege.

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...

conferenceService.CheckConferenceAvailability(props.bubble.id);
// Listen to the conference availability result.
   eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.   ConferenceCapability, (eventData: boolean) => {
       // handle conference availability result.
    });
```

### Get Active Speaker in conference call

---

You get the active speaker who is talking during the active conference call by using `conferenceObject.activeSpeaker`, where the `conferenceObject` is of type `IConference` and you can listen to `EventType.CurrentConferenceUpdated`, that will be triggered when when there is any changes happened on the conference including the `activeSpeaker` changes

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...

conferenceObject.activeSpeaker
// Listen to the conference changes result.
   eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.CurrentConferenceUpdated, (call?: IConference) => {
       // do what you want with the active speaker object result.
       let speaker  = call?.activeSpeaker;
    });
```

### Hang Up Myself from Conference

---

To leave a conference call without ending it for other participants, you can use `conferenceService.hangUpMyself(conferenceRoomId: string)`. This is useful when you want to leave the conference but allow it to continue for other participants.

```ts
import { conferenceService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const leaveConference = (conferenceRoomId: string) => {
    conferenceService.hangUpMyself(conferenceRoomId);
}
```

`Please Note:` This method only removes the current user from the conference. The conference will continue for other participants if there are still participants remaining.
