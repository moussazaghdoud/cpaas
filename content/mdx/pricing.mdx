![](/static/media/business-offer-4.8b513a3375c7d61230169dedea188297.svg)

By tailored business models, we mean that we can propose pricing models that are more predictable in costs than a pay-as-you-go model (price per user, per company, per bot, per interaction or any other metric that may fit your project).

---

![](/static/media/business-offer-5.9b3ca40b5103804bf5e49ae793294b17.svg)

Those models allow you and/or your customers to have a better alignement between the metrics that matter to you and your customer, and the Rainbow services and resources consumption of your application.

**Notes:**

\[1\] As an ALE Business Partner, the use of a provisioning application that you have developed is free.
