eventEmitter.addListener(
  EventType.CallLogsUpdated,
  (eventData: ICallLog[]) => {
    // handle call logs list

// listen for voicemail capabilities update
eventEmitter.addListener(
  EventType.VoiceMailCapabilitiesUpdated,
  (capabilities: IVoiceMailCapabilities) => {
    console.log('Voicemail capabilities:', capabilities);

}

interface ICallLogInfo {
  date: number;              // Timestamp of the call
  duration: string;          // Duration of the call
  state: CallLogState;       // State of the call (missed, answered, etc.)
  outgoing: boolean;         // Whether the call was outgoing
  isConference: boolean;     // Whether the call was a conference call

enum CallLogState {
  MISSED = 'missed',
