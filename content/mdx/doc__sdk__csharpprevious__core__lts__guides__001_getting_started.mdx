# Documentation

Getting started

LTS release 2.6.XPublished on 2021-12-13

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise **Rainbow CSharp SDK (core)** !

It's an **Assembly** library based on **CSharp** for connecting your application to Rainbow.

This assembly is multi-platform: you can use it on Windows, MacOs, Linux but also on Android, iOS and more.

Its powerful APIs enable you to create the best application that connect to Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise [Rainbow](https://www.openrainbow.com).

This tutorial will help you start with the ALE Rainbow SDK for CSharp (Core) by setting your environment wether you are using **Windows**, **Linux** or **MacOS**.

UI Controls according to build quickly / easily an applicatin are provided in others packages specific by platform. But their interface are the same what ever the platform.

### Prerequisites

---

#### Assembly in .Net Standard 2.0, .Net Standard 2.1, .Net 6.0 and .Net 8.0

---

The SDK is an Assembly targeting .Net Standard 2.0, .Net Standard 2.1, .Net 6.0 and .Net 6.0 so it can be used in those environments:

-   .NET and .Net Core 2.0+
-   .NET Framework 4.6.1+
-   Mono 5.4+
-   Xamarin.iOS 10.14+
-   Xamarin.Android 8.0+
-   Unity 2018.1+
-   Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299+

More details [here](https://immo.landwerth.net/netstandard-versions)

#### Nuget package

---

The SDK is provided as a Nuget package available [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rainbow.CSharp.SDK/)

Dependencies are all managed by Nuget package system.

#### Development environment

---

You can use:

-   ["Visual Studio for Windows"](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - the community edition is free
-   ["Visual Studio for Mac"](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/mac/)
-   ["Visual Studio Code"](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Free for Linux, Mac and Windows

If you are using a computer running on MacOS, you can follow [this guide](/docs/sdk/csharp) to setup your development environment.

### Setup your Visual Studio project

---

#### Install "Rainbow.CSharp.SDK" as Nuget package

---

##### In Studio Visual Studio 2019 (or more recent)

---

Use the [NuGet Package Manager UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui) and install the package "Rainbow.CSharp.SDK"

### Initialize the SDK

---

#### Step 1 : Create a Rainbow application on the developers web site

---

To use the SDK you need an `applicationID` and a `secretKey` from the [developers website](/). These information allow you to identify your application and allow you to use the rainbow platform. For more information, see [Applications lifecycle](/docs/hub/application-lifecycle) which explains what is the purpose, how to create an application and how to get the application ID and the secret key.

The `hostname` is also necessary to know which server is used: [the sandbox](/docs/hub/developer-sandboxed-platform) or [the production server](/docs/hub/get-ready-for-production)

#### Step 2 : Initialize the SDK

---

In your development environment, create an `Rainbow.Application` object like this:

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();
myApp.SetApplicationInfo(applicationID, secretKey);
myApp.SetHostInfo(hostname);
```

Where `myApp` is your application object:

-   with `applicationID` / `secretKey` from your Rainbow application created in step 1.
-   with `hostname` according the server used (\`sandbox.openrainbow.com' or 'openrainbow.com')

After that you can [Connect to Rainbow](/docs/sdk/csharp).
