---

### \[0.0.13-STS\] - 2024-01-15

#### Added

-   Add .Net 8.0 as target plateform (.Net Std 2.0, 2.1 and .Net 6.0 are still in targets platform) .Net 6.0 target platform will be removed in April.
-   (Alpha support) Allow to manage DataChannel in a Conference . Only one DataChannel can be created for the moment by user but several can be subscribed.

#### Fixed

-   PeerConnection are closed/disposed in a better way
-   in P2P and Conference, media status are set correctly: SendRecv, SendOnly, RecvOnly, Inactive

---

### \[0.0.12-STS\] - 2023-12-08

#### Fixed

-   `WebRTCCommunications`: Event `CallUpdated` could be not raised if a media was added or removed in conference by a remote peer

---

#### Changed

-   Use last version of SDK.Medias to use FFmpeg v6.0 libraries
-   WebRTCCommunications: Allow to set ConfigurationOptions object in MakeCall(), AnswerCall(), StartAndJoinConference(), JoinConference(), AddVideo(), AddSharing(), AddDataChannel()

---

### \[0.0.10\] - STS - 2023-07-07

---

## Enhancements

-   **Allow to suscribe to dynamic feed** (i.e. to see in one stream the active talker if he's using its web cam):
    -   **DynamicFeed** property (new) in **MediaPublication** object must be set to true when **SubscribeToMediaPublication** is used to subscribe to video media publication.
    -   Once subscription is done, event **OnTrack** is raised. Then the **DynamicFeed** property (new) of **MediaStreamTrackDescriptor** object permits to know that this track contains the dynamic feed.

## Framework targets

-   .Net Core App 3.1 is no more targetted (already deprecated by Microsoft).
-   .Net Standardd 2.0 / 2.1 and .Net 6.0 are still targetted

### \[0.0.9\] - STS - 2023-05-26

---

## Fix:

-   Test to check if Video subscription must be done was incorrect
-   In Conference, when sharing is added, a session-initiate is received. We have to send session-terminate if we don't subscribe to it.
-   In Conference: Subscribe/Unsubscribe on Media before/after the join is now well managed.
-   In P2P, Video and Sharing stream from remote are handled faster
-   Correclty handle stream status to create a valid SDP

## Enhancements:

Architecture has been reworked to build a common library compatible with a **Desktop WebRTC implementation** and **Unity WebRTC implementation**.

The **Desktop WebRTC implementation** is equivalent in term of features, dependencies and target platform as the previous version of this library: - Based on **SipSorcery**, **FFmpeg** and **SDL2** - Target **Windows, MacOS** and **Linux**

The **Unity WebRTC implementation** permits to use Rainbow SDK C# with WebRTC features in a **Unity project** - **Unity** use the WebRTC implementation provided by the Chromium project. - **Unity** targets Android, iOS but also Windows, Mac, Linux, Extended Reality devices (XR), Consoles (PS5, XBox, Switch), WebGL

It was necessary to create a new package called **Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Abstractions** which provide objects and interfaces to inherit / use to be compatible with this new package architecture.

To provide **Desktop WebRTC implementation**, a new Nuget package, **Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Desktop**, implements interfaces and use objects defined in **Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Abstractions**.

To provide **Unity WebRTC implementation**, a new Unity package, **Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Unity**, implements interfaces and use objects defined in **Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Abstractions**. This package is not yet available publicly but it has been tested with success on Android and some XR devices

There is no more media or device management in this package. It's done in each implementation since it's specific for each.

### \[0.0.8\] - STS - 2023-02-10

---

-   Thanks to new version of the **SDK C# Medias**, it's now possible to decode incoming media (Audio, Video and Sharing ) from P2P call or Conference call.
    
-   **Connecting** state is now correctly managed to avoid to add/remove a media when it's not possible
    
-   Internally several fixes have been done to avoid CPU usage, to enhance memory management and to clean seveal parts of the code
    

### \[0.0.7\] - STS - 2023-01-20

---

-   Major rework to avoid memory leak. Use of **IDisposable** interface in objects using unmanaged objects to ensure to dispose them.
    
-   `StartAndJoinConference` and `JoinConference` no more use parameters about media subscriptions
    
-   Methods about media subscriptions have been renamed for simplification and can be used in Conference or P2P context:
    
    -   IsSubscribedToMediaPublication
        
    -   SubscribeToMediaPublication
        
    -   UnsubscribeToMediaPublication
        
    -   IsSharingPublicationAvailable
        
    -   CanSubscribeToMediaPublication
        
    -   GetMediaPublicationsSubscribed
        
    -   GetMediaPublicationsAvailable
        
    -   AllowToSubscribeToHisOwnMediaPublication (not useable in a P2P context)
        
-   `ImageDelegateInCall` and `ErrorDelegateInCall` events now use parameter **media** to know more specifcally which kind of media is used (Video or Sharing)
    
-   `ConferenceMediaPublicationUpdated' has been renamed`OnMediaPublicationUpdated\`
    

### \[0.0.6\] - STS - 2022-12-07

---

-   Fix NAT Traversal problem: Fix mainly P2P calls which could not be created according network topology of users.
    
-   Fix media switch: (for example from one video stream to another one): avoid to send new SDP negociation
    
-   Fix several memory links
    
-   Great Rework of the API to use new package `Rainbow.SDK.Medias`
    
    -   `Rainbow.SDK.Medias` package is dedicated to manage Video / Audio streams (local / remote file, IP TV, Stream server), Devices detection and uses (Webcam, Screen, Headset, Speaker, Microphone)
        
    -   Allow to create a Video stream from one or several video streams using filters:
        
        -   scale, crop, pad, resize, change fps, add subtitles can be done
            
        -   mosaic / overlay can be used to display several streams as input to create one ouput
            
        -   and lot more - read documentation of this package
            

### \[0.0.5\] - STS - 2022-10-05

---

-   Enriched documentation
    
-   Technical delivery to modify the validity date of the SDK
    

### \[0.0.4\] - STS - 2022-09-14

---

## Fix

Catch exception when trying to send Video or Audio packets on a no more valid Peer Connection

### \[0.0.3\] - STS - 2022-08-23

---

## Fix

An error could be raised when audio negociation is performed again for the same communications (for example when a media is added or removed).

## Enhancements

**It's now possible to log on different files if several instance of the SDK (Core) is used in sametime** (for example if you use several bots in the same process).

You need to set to the new parameter `loggerPrefix` a different value for each instance when `Rainbow.Application` object is created. You also need to use a different configuration file for your logger. See the online documentation for more details.

You have nothing more to change when WebRTCCommunications is created.used for this.

### \[0.0.2\] - STS - 2022-07-01

---

### Enhancement

**WebRTCCommunications service**:

-   Add events OnAudioLocalSourceError, OnAudioPlaybackSourceError, OnVideoLocalSourceError and OnSharingLocalSourceError. These events are triggered when a device is not reachable OR when in use it's no more accessible (device unplugged, file no more accessible)
-   GetVideoRecordingDevices method accepts 2 optional parameters **cameraInput**, **monitorInput** (both set to true by default) to avoid to get Camera and/or Monitor as Video input devices

### Fix:

**WebRTCCommunications service**: In Conference allow to stream the same file with Audio AND Video in same time. It's was already ok in P2P.

[Samples](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/WebRTC) have been updated to use the new version of this SDK

### \[0.0.1\] - STS - 2022-06-15
