Supporting IE11

LTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21

## Supporting IE11

---

**UPDATE OCTOBER 2019**: Rainbow Web SDK does not currently support Internet Explorer 11. It is however possible to develop a special version depending on the needs of your project. Please contact your Rainbow representative in order to discuss the details.

The details below represent a helpful hints on how to provide the absolute minimum to ensure Internet Explorer 11 capabilities to run special Rainbow Web SDK version tailored for your needs.

### Adding ES6 compatibility

---

Internet Explorer 11 doesn't support recent standardized specification released in ECMAScript 6 (ECMAScript 2015) like JavaScript Promise implementation, Array advanced methods etc.

Consequently, the Rainbow Web application is not compliant with that browser.

Regarding the SDK for Web, the compatibility can be provided by adding some extra libraries (aka ECMAScript shim) in your HTML file that are loaded before the SDK for Web.

You need to add the following lines in your HTML file:

```html
<!-- Add the following lines to your 'index.html' file -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en" ng-controller="sampleController">
    <head>
        <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/4.5.9/es5-shim.min.js"></script>
        <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es6-promise/4.0.5/es6-promise.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/promise-polyfill@8/dist/polyfill.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/string.prototype.startswith@0.2.0/startswith.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jspolyfill-array.prototype.findIndex@0.1.0/findIndex.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.6.15/browser-polyfill.min.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>
```

Here's an explanation of what those libraries actually do:

`es5-shim` and `es6-shim` will provide the compatibility with the Internet Explorer 11 by offering all the missing JavaScript features. `polyfill` for adding Promise polyfill `startswith` is needed to provide String.prototype.startsWith (if needed) `findIndex` is needed to provide Array.prototype.findIndex (if needed)

Feel free to use your own shim/polyfill if your project needs them.

### Example for sending a file, for example in a Bubble, thanks to Esben from the Forum

As IE11 doesn't support File creator (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) an existing way is to use a XMLHttpRequest() to download it

```js
function blobToFile(theBlob, fileName) {
    //A Blob() is almost a File() - it's just missing the two properties below which we will add
    theBlob.lastModifiedDate = newDate();
    theBlob.name = fileName;
    return theBlob;
}

function insertImageInBubble(ownedBubble) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", "https://url.to/image.jpg");
    xhr.overrideMimeType("image/jpeg");
    xhr.responseType = "blob"; //force the HTTP response, response-type header to be blob
    xhr.onload = function () {
        var myFile = blobToFile(xhr.response, "image.jpg");
        rainbowSDK.fileStorage.uploadFileToBubble(ownedBubble, myFile, "Demo image");
    }
    xhr.send();
};
```

### WebRTC audio and video limitation

---

When using Internet Explorer 11, you can't access to Rainbow audio and video services based on WebRTC.

When calling these methods from the Rainbow SDK for Web, you will receive a JSON error message explaining that this feature is not supported by your browser.

Here is the list of methods not supported on IE 11:

-   WebRTCService: `callInAudio()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `callInVideo()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `answerInAudio()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `answerInVideo()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `showLocalVideo()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `hideLocalVideo()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `showRemoteVideo()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `hideRemoteVideo()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `escaladeToVideoCall()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `reverseToAudioCall()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `muteAudioCall()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `muteVideoCall()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `unmuteAudioCall()`
    
-   WebRTCService: `unmuteVideoCall()`
