# Interface: DirectorySearchOptions

## Properties

### company?

> `optional` **company**: [`CompanyOptions`](doc/sdk/webv2/lts/api/DirectorySearch/interfaces/CompanyOptions)

Company filter to refine the search to include or exclude users/contacts of this company. Default value is null meaning that no company filter is specified. This option is only valid for searches in RAINBOW\_USERS and RAINBOW\_BUSINESS\_CONTACTS\_DIRECTORY directories. If the option is specified but not managed for the given directory type, it will be ignored.

### extendedMode?

> `optional` **extendedMode**: `boolean`

Allows to search the user/contact on extended fields. \[default value=false\] Default value is false. In addition to the name-fields used by a "basic" search, an extended search will be carried out on addition fields such as the job title or the company name for example. The complete list of fields used in a extended search is described below. This extended search is only available to user having the feature SEARCH\_BY\_TAGS in their profile. If this option is set but the user does not have the feature SEARCH\_BY\_TAGS, the option is ignored and the search is performed in simple mode. Furthermore, a warning is logged. This option is managed differently depending on the directory type, as described below:

-   RAINBOW\_USERS\_NETWORK: The extended search is not available.
