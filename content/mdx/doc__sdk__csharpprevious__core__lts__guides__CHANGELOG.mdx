# Documentation

Changelog

LTS release 2.6.XPublished on 2021-12-13Compare

## SDK (Core) for C#

### \[2.6.26-LTS\] - 2024-11-22

#### Fixed

-   Ensure to send one by one message to XMPP server (when XMPP event mode is used)
-   Support by default HTTP Status 204 (No Content)
-   `Application` service: avoid to set default presence to **Offline**. Use **Online** instead
-   `AutoReconnection` service: badly managed **401 Unauthorized** when renewing authentication token
-   `Bubbles` service: avoid triggering `BubbleAffiliationChanged` in inappropriate cases.

---

### \[2.6.25-LTS\] - 2024-07-17

#### Fixed

-   Internally use **XmlElement** object instead of String to avoid problem of parsing.
-   `Bubbles` service: `GetAllMembers()` and `GetMembersFromCache()` methods - **memberPrivilege** filter badly used if \*\*memberStatus \*\* filter is null.

#### Added

-   `Company` object: `AutoAddToUserNetwork` property

---

### \[2.6.24-LTS\] - 2024-07-01

#### Info

-   For simplification and from this version, the SDK always retrieves the list of bubbles and the complete list of their members (if `Restrictions.UseBubbles` is used) and the list of conversations after connection/reconnection. It is therefore no longer necessary to ask for it.
-   A new guide has been added to describe what data is stored in the cache, and when it is obtained/refreshed during connection or reconnection phases.

#### Fixed

-   Avoid crash in very restrictive environment (like in Alpine linux distribution) where `CulturInfo` object cannot be created.
-   Ensure to answer to XMPP server on **close** message (rfc7395 - section 3.6)
-   `Application` service: `LoginWithToken` method accepts token as string or ApplicationToken as JSON.
-   `Bubbles` service: `BubbleMemberUpdated` event might not be triggered after a reconnection or when a new bubble owner was set.
-   `InstantMessaging` service: `SendAckMessage` method now always escapes content.

#### Added

-   `Bubble` object: `LastActivityDate` and `UsersById` (dictionary of Users by Id).
-   `Bubbles` service: `BubbleAffiliationsPerformed()` event is fired after login/reconnect when the current user has joined all their bubbles. If it is not a member of any bubble, the event is also triggered.
-   `Bubbles` service: `IsUnsubscribed()` to know if user is unsubscribed to a bubble.
-   `Bubbles` service: `GetBubbles()` now ensure to provide the full list of members (even if there is more than 100 members).
-   `Bubbles` service: `GetBubbles()` and `GetAllBubblesFromCache()` have a new optional parameter **memberStatus** (null by default) to filter results.
-   `Bubbles` service: `GetMembers()` have two new optionals parameters **memberStatus** (null by default) and **memberPrivilege** (null by default) to filter results.
-   `Bubbles` service: `GetOwner()`, `GetModerators()` and `IsBubbleAffiliated()` methods
-   `BubbleMember` object: `UserJid` property
-   `HttpClient` object: If necessary, check inner-exception to avoid unnecessary disconnection.
-   `HttpClient` object: To enhance performance, according REST API used and server settings, specific HTTP Headers are added - for example to manage Conference or Teams Presence using the correct Data Center.
-   `Restrictions` object: `UseTelephony` and `UseBubbles` (both to true by default to be backwards compatible) allow to limit the use of Telephony and Bubbles services if they are not necessary.
-   `Restrictions` object: `LogBubbleMembers` (false by default) to log also members when a log entry about Bubble is saved
-   `Util.LogAnonymously()`: To log entries anonomouslys (by default) or not - useful in development phase.
-   `Util.RaiseEvent()`: permits to log events raised or not raised according values of `Restrictions.LogEvent` and `Restrictions.LogEventRaised` (both true by default). If an event is not raised, it means that no code is using it.
-   `WebRTCSettings` object: Once loggued/connected, if WebRTC is used, settings are retrieved and accessible using `Application.WebRTCSettings` property

#### Changed

-   **Breaking** `BubbleMemberEventArgs`: `Member` as `BubbleMember` objects replaces `ContactJid, ContactId, Status` and `Privilege`
-   **Breaking** `Restrictions`: `AlertMessage` renamed to `UseAlerts` for coherency
-   `Util.LogString()`: Still log first and last caracter but now log also the full length (before caracter '-' was used to replace hidden caracters)
-   `Util.Raise()`: Now **Obsolete**, use instead `Util.RaiseEvent()`
-   `Util.SerializeException()`: Use standard way to log exception. It permits to have more info (call stack for example)
-   **.Net 6.0** as target platform has been removed (obsolete). **.Net Std 2.0, 2.1** and **.Net 8.0** are still in targets platform.

---

### \[2.6.23.1-LTS\] - 2024-05-28

---

### \[2.6.18-LTS\] - 2023-09-05

#### Fixed

-   Administration: CreateSelfRegisteredUser() can be used without to be authenticated/connected.
-   Application: If IniFile cannot be created when using Application object, data are stored in memory instead.
-   AutoReconnection: In Unity environment some events are not supported (NetworkChange.NetworkAddressChanged and NetworkChange.NetworkAvailabilityChanged). In this case, a Polling is used.
-   AutoReconnection: Under certain race conditions, the AutoReconnection service cannot continue its process.
-   JSON Parser: Allow to parse "true", "false", "0" or "1" as valid JSON Boolean (i.e. from a String). Allow to parse String (for example) "123" as valid JSON Numeric. Not standard but can be found in Rainbow server response.
-   HttpClient: Get total seconds in RetryAfter HTTP Header (and not only seconds of the delay returned).

#### Added

-   Application: Inherits from IDisposable.
-   AutoReconnection: Added CheckNetworkInterfaces property (true by default) to avoid network interfaces detection if necessary (when set to False).

-   AutoReconnection: Network interfaces with operational status equals to unknown are also taken into account if no one is up.
-   SdkError: HttpStatusCode property is now an int (no more an enum).
-   ConnectionStateEventArgs: Now contains ConnectionState object as property

---

### \[2.6.17\] - LTS - 2023-07-07

---

## Enhancements

-   **Auto-Reconnection service is now always used** (it's no more optional):
    
    -   Methods **LoginUsingPrevisouCredentials** and **Login** have been removed. Use equivalent methods in **Application** service.
    -   **AutoReconnection** property in **Restrictions** object is no more useful so it has been removed.
-   **Application service**:
    
    -   Any method in **Application** service related to login step will start automatically the **Auto-Reconnection service:**
    -   There is now 8 methods (without including SSO) to start a login step:
        -   Login / LoginWithoutEventPipe
        -   LoginUsingPreviousCredentials / LoginUsingPreviousCredentialsWithoutEventPipe
        -   LoginWithToken / LoginWithTokenWithoutEventPipe (for both, as parameter with an ApplicationToken object or an ApplicationToken as JSON)
    -   In consequence callback of these methods as lighlty changed. Should have no impact in most of the case.
    -   New events added:
        -   **AuthenticationFailed**: When the server don't accept credentials and why.
        -   **ReadyTologOnEventPipe**: For advanced scenarion, when the login step is used without automatic connection to event pipe
-   **MediaPublication** object:
    
    -   **DynamicFeed** property (new) permits to know if the media publication is a dynamic feed or not. So it's possible to alway see the active talker using one video media publication

## Updates

-   In **Restrictions** object obsolete properties have been removed: **UseAPIConferenceV2** and **UseMessageEditionAndDeletionV2**

## Framework targets

-   .Net Core App 3.1 is no more targetted (already deprecated by Microsoft).
-   .Net Standardd 2.0 / 2.1 and .Net 6.0 are still targetted

### \[2.6.16.1\] - LTS - 2023-06-15

---

## Fix

-   `TaskCanceledException` with inner exception `TimeoutException` was mishandled in `HttpClient`
-   Store `Channel` objects in internal cache even if found using search APIs
-   JSON parsing was not done correctly on null properties. As a result, parsing `DateTime` objects with a null property returned `DateTime.UTCNow` instead of `DateTime.MinValue`
-   Wrong URI used to access media pillar information
-   Fix bad race condition which didn't allow to use LoginToEventPipe() just after LoginWithoutEventPipe()
-   Fix ConferenceGetFullSnapshot: participants were not well managed

### \[2.6.16\] - LTS - 2023-05-26

---

## Fix

-   XMPP Iq messages (set as result only) were not released from memory once managed.
-   According some race condition, Bubble/Conference could not be joined.
-   Fix crash if IniFileParser could not be created (incorrect path specified and the default one can be used too)
-   WebRTC context: Ice Candidate and senders property were badly set in Jingle Messages.

## Enhancements

-   **SDK now supports AOT** (Ahead Of Time) Compilation and is compatible with **Unity framework** and its **IL2CPP** (Intermediate Language To C++) scripting backend
    
    -   All codes about REST and JSON have been reworked in consequence.
    -   It was also necessary to change some properties name to ensure correct JSON parsing.
-   **Static SDK errors list:**
    
    -   Now if the SDK itself raised an error, a specific **ErrorCode** and **ErrorDetailsCode** are used. See `SdkInternalError enum` for a full list.
-   **Auto-Reconnection service:**
    
    -   Handles correctly **429 - Too Many Requests** and **503 - Service Unavailable** returned by the server.
    -   This service will stop **ONLY** when a **"401 - Unauthorized"** is returned by the server when **Login** and/or **Login With Token** REST Requests are used.
    -   Smooth reconnection (i.e. the cache is not always deleted) according the disconnection context.
    -   The counter "current nb attempts" is now set to zero only once the authentication process AND the initialization process are both done succesfully.
    -   It's now possible to add a random delay between each attempts using **MaxRandomDelayBetwenAttemps**.
    -   Add Login method (so it's now possible to directly use this service even for the first login) - see **AutoReconnection.Login()** and **AutoReconnection.LoginUsingPreviousCredentials()** methods
    -   **This service will no more be optional in next release.**
-   **Proxy**
    
    -   Before only an Url with login/pwd (optional) could be set. Now a **WebProxy** object can be set allowing more options.
-   **Restrict use of HttpClient:**
    
    -   Use only one HttpClient object to access Rainbow Server to increase performance (Several requests can still be performed in same time).
    -   If necessary another one is available to access any other server - see **Application.GetHttpClient()** and **Application.GetSecondaryHttpClient()**.
    -   Both are using the same **WebProxy** settings.
-   **JSON Parser**
    
    -   A new JSON Parser is used using **SimpleJSON** library now embedded in the SDK which replaces `Newtonsoft.Json`.
    -   **UtilJSON** class has also been added to facilitate its usage.
    -   Read a new dedicated guide available in the online documentation web site if you need to use also a JSON parser.
-   **Randomization** process is now centralised and use only one **Random** object.
    

## Framework targets

-   .Net Standardd 2.0 and 2.1 are still supported.
-   .Net Core App 3.1 will be removed in the next release (already deprecated by Microsoft).
-   .Net 5.0 has been removed (already deprecated by Microsoft).
-   .Net 6.0 has been added.

## Dependencies

-   Dependencies no more used: `Newtonsoft.Json`, `RestSharp` and `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt`
    
    -   This libraries (with their own dependencies) was huge with a lot of features but not all really used. And it was necessary to folllow security warnings and new versions.
-   Dependency added and directly embedded in the SDK: `SimpleJson` (MIT License)
    
    -   It's a very smart library which does greatly its job. It's AOT compatible and very stable.
-   Dependency `Sharp.Ws.Xmpp` now uses `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` `v7.0.0` (before v6.0.0 was used)

## Fix

-   Using XMPP event mode, Calendar presence was not correctly taken into account
    
-   Webinar were badly managed as Conference. It's no more the case. (Webinar are not managed yet)
    
-   Server can return error in REST API calls without ErrorCode, ErrorMsg, ErrorDetails and/or ErrorDetailsCode. When it's the case, the parsing was failing

## Enhancements

-   BasicLoggerFactory

A new class **BasicLoggerFactory** permits to easily manage logging features without the need of any third party (like NLog or Log4Net for example)

It's a very basic one since an event is raised each time a log entry is added but can be very usefull.

-   Delete all messages in a Bubble

    -   Teams Presence is now taken into account if user has activated it (internal reference RQRAINB-8649). Calendar Presence has also been fixed.
        
    -   To support this a rework was necessary: **Presence** object has new properties/methods. **PresenceInfo** and **PresenceCalendar** have been removed
        
    -   It permits to build a correct Aggregated Presence when **XMPP event mode** is used. Due to current server restriction, using **S2S event mode** or **REST API** only don't permit to build a correct Aggregated Presence.
        
-   AutoReconnection server and stream error returned by the server.
    
    -   Now the AutoReconnection service is no more stopped and the Web Sockect is not more closed each time a stream error is returned by the server.
        
    -   Accodring the stream error a criticity taken is set - see **ConnectionStateEventArgs** object and **AutoReconnection** service for more details
        
-   Simplification in **Conferences** service:
    
    -   **MediaPublication** is used instead of **Conference.Publisher** and **Conference.PublisherMedia** which have has been removed
        
    -   **ConferencePublishersEventArgs** has been removed. Use instead **MediaPublicationsEventArgs**
        
    -   **ConferenceGetPublishersFromCache** has been removed. Use instead **ConferenceGetMediaPublicationsFromCache**
        
    -   All this permits to reduce code in **Conferences** service:

### \[2.6.13\] - LTS - 2022-12-07

---

## Fix

-   **Conferences** service:
    
    -   `GetConferencesInProgress` now correctly managed server answer if several conferences are in progress.
        
    -   `GetConversationByIdFromCache`, `GetConversationByPeerIdFromCache`, `GetConversationByJidFromCache`, `GetConversationIdByPeerIdFromCache` and `GetConversationIdByJidFromCache` now check if parameter specfied is null or empty
        
-   **Contacts** service:
    
    -   `SetBusyPresenceAccordingMedias` and `RollbackPresenceSavedFromCurrentContact` method set a bad priority to manage presence level
        
    -   `EnableCalendar` used a bad HTTP Method: PATCH instead of PUT
        
-   **InstantMessaging** service: Ensure to encode string in XML when alternat content is used to send messages
    
-   **Jingle** service: `SendIceCandidate` method was incorrect. An attribute was badly set. This permits to resolve NAT traversal trouble in WebRTC (occurred mainly in P2P context)
    

## Enhancements

-   Documentation enhancement about **password length which should be at least 12**. It's not yet mandatory but it'll be soon so it must be taken into account quickly.
    
-   **New HTTP Header** (`x-rainbow-client-id`) has been added in each REST request to improve support on server side
    
-   **CallParticipant** object: `FromContact` returns a valid object if a Phonenumber is not null but Contact object is.

    -   `Provider`: **new** The third party calendar used
        

### \[2.6.12\] - LTS - 2022-10-31

---

## Fix

-   Avoid throwing exceptions when there is server congestion

### \[2.6.11\] - LTS - 2022-10-05

---

## Important Notice

-   Editing or deleting messages has changed on server side. Nothing needs to be changed in terms of SDK API calls. However the property `Restrictions.UseMessageEditionAndDeletionV2` is now deprecated. Updating its value has no consequence since `MessageEditionAndDeletionV2` is now always used.

## Update

-   Enriched documentation

### \[2.6.10\] - LTS - 2022-09-14

---

## Important Notice

**Conferences service has been fully remorked**

-   It's `mandatory` to upgrade to this new SDK version if you are using these features.
-   Personal Conferences (i.e. PGI) have been removed
-   Old code about API Conferences V1 have been removed

## Fixes

### Telephony service:

No event was raised when a call is transfered. Now a new Call is created and an event CallUpdated is raised (internal ref. CRRAINB-28750).

### WebSocket connexion

In very rare case, an unhandled exception could be raised if the web socket cannot be opened.

### \[2.6.9\] - LTS - 2022-08-23

---

## Important Notice

-   Due to server update, only `Conference API V2` is now supported whatever the value set to `Restrictions.UseAPIConferenceV2` which is now obsolete.
    
-   Editing or deleting messages will change in future releases due to server updates. Nothing needs to be changed in terms of SDK API calls. However a new property `Restrictions.UseMessageEditionAndDeletionV2` allows to switch to this new version (false by default today). When the new version will be available, this property will be deprecated.
    

## Fixes

### AutoReconnection service:

If the server asked for the disconnection, this service is now automatically stopped and event `Cancelled` is raised with `DisconnectedByServer` as value. It's possible to have more details using `GetServerDisconnectionInformation` method. (internal reference: RQRAINB-7605)

This can occur if the same user has more than 5 active connections to the server using XMPP event mode. In this case you will have this information:

-   Reason: `resource-constraint`
-   Details `Max sessions reached`

### Bubbles service:

Method `GenerateNewPublicUrl` and `CreatePublicUrl` no more compute the URL but use the one specified by the server (internal reference: RQRAINB-7235)

### Instant Messaging service:

Method `EditMessage` didn't reset alternative contents (if any) of the message updated.

### WebSocket connexion

In rare case, no event could be raised if the web socket cannot be opened on first attempt.

## Enhancements

### Restrictions:

It's now possible to set the size of chunck when a file is uploaded or downloaded using this properties:

-   `ChunkSizeUpload`: Size (in bytes) of the chunck used when a file is uploaded - Default value 1048576 (1024 \* 1024 bytes => 1 Mb)
-   `MaxChunkSizeUpload`: Maximum size (in bytes) of the chunck authorized by the server when a file is uploaded (read only)
-   `ChunkSizeDownload`: Size (in bytes) of the chunck used when a file is downloaded - Default value 5242880 (1024 \* 1024 \* 5 bytes => 5 Mb)
-   `MaxChunkSizeDownload`: Maximum size (in bytes) of the chunck authorized by the server when a file is downloaded (read only)

### Application service:

It's now possible to set specific security protocol used in the SDK once `Application` service has been created using `SetSecurityProtocol` method. If this method is not used, the same defaults are used as in previous versions of the SDK. They are set like this:

```cs
#if NETCOREAPP || NET5_0_OR_GREATER
    // USE TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 only
    ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls13;
#elif NETSTANDARD
    // USE TLS 1.2 only
    ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
#endif
```

Event `ConnectionStateChanged` provide more information about the disconnection if it's the server which asked it.

**It's now possible to log on different files if several instance of the SDK is used in sametime** (for example if you use several bots in the same process). You need to set to the new parameter `loggerPrefix` a different value for each instance when `Rainbow.Application` object is created. You also need to use a different configuration file for your logger. See the online documentation for more details.

### AutoReconnection service:

The signature of the `Cancelled event` has been changed to make it easier to know the reason of the trigger: `Cancelled, DisconnectedByServer, InvalidCredentials, Logout, MaxNbAttemptsReached or TokenExpired`.

### Bubbles service:

The method `IsMember` has been renamed to `IsAccepted` (because a user can be a member but has not yet accepted the invitation and this method check the status Accepted).

Several methods accepts now an optional parameter to specify a userId (null by default - so to check current user): `IsAccepted, IsArchived, IsModerator`.

New methods added: `IsInvited, IsCreator, IsGuest, GetMemberOfBubble`.

### InstantMessaging service:

A new `EditMessage` method (with more parameters) permits to update a previous message with `a new body` and `with new alternative contents`.

### Telephony service:

New methods `MakeCall, MakeCallWithSubject and MakeCallToMevo` with resource as parameter to allow only one device (the one with using this resource) or all devices to accept this call (if no resource is specified) (internal reference: RQRAINB-4732)

### \[2.6.8\] - LTS - 2022-07-01

---

### Enhancement

**Contacts service:**

`SearchContactsByDisplayName`: if company Id is not specified, the search is performed in the company of the current user and outside of its company (so internally 2 requests to the server are done instead of one)

### \[2.6.7\] - LTS - 2022-06-15

---

### Fix

**Conferences service:**

-   `ConferenceSubscribeToParticipantVideoStream`: Bad parameter used to set SubStreamLevel

**InstantMessaging service:**

-   Remove internal tests which didn't permit to send file in **S2S event mode**.
-   Some presence level couldn't be set correclty in **S2S event mode**.

### Reorganization

-   **MessageType** object is now in **Rainbow.Model** namespace. Before it was in **Rainbow.Model.AckMessage** namespace. It impacts slightly methods using **AckMessage** object

### API update in details:

**InstantMessaging service:**

-   `AdHocCommandReceived`: **new** Event raised when the current user received an **AdHocCommand**
-   `AnwserToAdHocCommand`: **new** To answer to an **AdHocCommand** received.
-   `SendAdHocCommand`: **new** To send an **AdHocCommand** to a specific user resource (i.e. a specific device used by a user and not all of these devices).

**Conferences service:**

-   `ConferenceSharingTransfertStatusUpdated`: Event raised when the sharing transfer status has changed in a Conference. (based internally on specific **AdHocCommand** received)
-   `ConferenceSendSharingTransfertStatus`: To send sharing transfert status i.e. send a request or accept/refuse a sharing transfer. (based internally on specific **AdHocCommand**)
-   `ConferenceGetSharingPublisherDetails`: To get Jid and Resource of the sharing publisher in the specified Conference.

### \[2.6.6\] - LTS - 2022-05-23

---

### Fix

**Contacts service:**

-   `SearchContactsByDisplayName`, `SearchContactByPhoneNumber` and `Contacts.SearchContactsByTag`: CompanyId parameter was badly used to restrict the search

### API update in details:

**Call object**

-   `ConferenceId`: **new** To know the Conference Id if this object describes a communication in a Conference context
-   `ConferenceJid`: **new** To know the Conference Jid if this Call object describes a communication in a Conference context
-   `IsRemoteVideoMuted`: **removed**

**Call.Type enum**

-   `WEBRTC_P2P`: **renamed** Before it was `WEBRTC`
-   `WEBRTC_CONFERENCE`: **renamed** Before it was `CONFERENCE`

**Publisher object**

-   `Medias`: **renamed and updated** Before it was `Media` and now it's a list of `PublisherMedia` objects (before it was a list of String)

**PublisherMedia object** `new`

-   `Media`: **new** Media used by the publisher - can be "sharing" or "video"
-   `Simulcast`: **new** To indicate if this media is sent using simulcast or not

-   `ConferenceJoin`: **updated** Callback now returns the Conferecen Jid on success (before it was True)

### \[2.6.5\] - LTS - 2022-05-04

---

### Fix

-   **AutoReconnection**: Prevent exception when trying to postpone internal Cancelable Delay object which could be null.
-   **Conferences**: Even if an admin user is connected, get only Conference End Points of the current user in login process.

### \[2.6.4\] - LTS - 2022-04-07

---

### AckMessage

**New kind of message (with ack)** which permits to send information to a **specific ressource/device** of a user (and not to all ressources/devices of a user).

Using these messages **does not interact with current IM features** in standard Rainbow Applications (i.e UCaaS application): they are not seen and not stored in the message history.

When sending an AckMessage you can specify an **action**, a **mime type** and a **content** (using a String or a XmlElement).

On Reception, you can answer using them kind of parameters.

To know the list of ressources/devices of one user, you can use **Contacts.GetPresencesFromContactId** method which provides presences list of the specified contact for all his ressources/devices.

### Fix

-   **Channels**: **GetDetailedAppreciations** could not retunrs all Appreciations
-   **FileStorage**: **CreateFileDescriptor** and **UploadFile** now returns an error if they are used in Channel context. **Channels.UpdateAvatarFromChannelId** method must be used instead to update Channel Avatar.

-   `UploadFile`: **fix** Return an error if used in Channel context

**Channels service:**

-   `GetDetailedAppreciations`: **fix** Could not return all appreciations

### \[2.6.3\] - LTS - 2022-03-16

---

### Conference API V2

In this version, Conference API V2 (for WebRTC conference) is supported. A flag (see **Restrictions.UseAPIConferenceV2** - to set before any login process) permits to use V1 (by default) or V2. At term, only the V2 will be used/available.

This doesn't affect Personal Conference (i.e. Conference using PSTN devices)

Since Conferences features have increased, there are now centralized in **Conferences** service (accessible using **Application.GetConferences()**). Before they were avaialble in **Bubbles** service.

**NOTE**: the flag **Restrictions.UseConferences** (true by default) permits to win some time in login process (if set to false) if you don't need to use these features.

### Logging enhancement

A new flag (see **Restrictions.LogSdkResultOnError**) set to true by default allows to log any error occuring when a REST API is used.

Before it was necessary, for the developper using the SDK, to log them individually. To improve analysis, it's now automatic (at least if log functionality are used) if this flag is set to true.

### Directory Contact

It's now possible to manage **Personal Directory Contact** or **Company Directoy Contact**.

**DirectoryContact** object has also more properties than before.

### Fix

-   In S2S Context, IM message could not be sent.
-   ChannelInfoUpdated event could be raised instead of then ChannelCreated event.

### \[2.6.2\] - LTS - 2022-01-27

---

In this version, a code reorganization has been done about WebRTC features:

-   some classes/event have been renamed or changed of namespace
-   some methods have moved

If don't use **WebRTC features**, you are not impacted.

If you use the **SDK.Wpf.WebControl** component, you are not impacted too since this component has been also updated to provide same features.

**You are only impacted if you directly use the WebRTC service.**

### Code reorganization and enhancements

Some classes are now in a different namespaces and/or have been renamed:

-   **Rainbow.WebRTC** is now **Rainbow.Jingle**
-   **Rainbow.Jingle.IceCandidate** is now **Rainbow.Model.Jingle.IceCandidate**
-   **Rainbow.Jingle.JingleSession** is now **Rainbow.Model.Jingle.JingleSession**
-   **Rainbow.Jingle.IceCandidatesEventArgs** is now **Rainbow.Events.IceCandidatesEventArgs**
-   **Rainbow.Jingle.RemoteDescriptionEventArgs** is now **Rainbow.Events.RemoteSDPEventArgs**

Some methods have been also moved, check the API update details below.

In this version, the way to manage WebRTC signaling messages (i.e. Jingle messages) has been improved. It's now possible to manage several WebRTC communication in same time.

**SDK.Wpf.WebControl** has been updated to use this version even it don't offer the possibility to have several WebRTC communications. Same features are still available.

In fact **SDK.Wpf.WebControl** will be soon obsolete when the current work in progress will be finished: it will offer the possibility to make WebRTC communication not only in **WPF** context but also in **Windows.Forms** and **UWP** context.

It's based on modules 100% written in C# or modules available in multi-platform environments. So soon it will be also possible to have WebRTC communication in **Mac OS**.

Next steps will be to have the same for Android and iOS.

### Fixes:

-   **Bubbles**: Fix **ConferenceJoin()** method when used in WebRTC context.
-   **FileStorage**: Take into account recorded file (using **ConferenceRecordingStart()** in Bubbles service. A new event has been added: **RecordingFileUpdated**.
-   **Jingle to media parsing**: Fix about default port used and **ssrc** options

### \[2.6.0\] - LTS - 2021-11-18

---

### Enhancements / Fixes:

**Use logging abstraction**

In previous release, **Nlog** was used internally in the SDK for log purpose.

In this release, the SDK now use the logging abstraction introduced by Microsoft called **MEL** (**Microsoft.Extensions.Logging**) . It's available in **.Net Core** so it's **multi-platform**.

So now you can use any back-end log providers based on **MEL** (non-exhaustive list):

-   [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet) provider for the Sentry service
-   [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-framework-logging) provider for the Serilog service
-   [elmah.io](https://github.com/elmahio/Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging) provider for the elmah.io service
-   [Loggr](https://github.com/imobile3/Loggr.Extensions.Logging) provider for the Loggr service
-   [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog.Extensions.Logging) provider for the NLog service
-   [Graylog](https://github.com/mattwcole/gelf-extensions-logging) provider for the Graylog service
-   [Sharpbrake](https://github.com/airbrake/sharpbrake#microsoftextensionslogging-integration) provider for the Sharpbrake service
-   [KissLog.net](https://github.com/catalingavan/KissLog-net) provider for the KissLog.net service

The documentation has been updated and provide two examples to use **Nlog** and **SeriLog** as back-end.

**Management of Emergency Message has changed**

In a one to one conversation, an emergency message can be sent only if the peer has the **Rainbow Alert license**.

In a bubble, an emergency message can be sent only if one its member has the **Rainbow Alert license**.

The SDK provides two methods to know if it's allowed (in **InstantMessaging** service):

-   Boolean **CanSendMessageWithHighUrgencyToConversation**(String conversationId)
-   Boolean **CanSendMessageWithHighUrgencyToConversation**(Conversation conversation)

In consequence two capabilities has been removed (in **Contact.Capability**)

-   **MessageUrgencySending**
-   **MessageUrgencyReception**

It's possible to know if a contact has a Rainbow Alert license using the property **IsAlertNotificationEnabled** of **Contact** object.

It's possible to know if a buble has at least one member with a Rainbow Alert license using the property **IsAlertNotificationEnabled** of the **Bubble** object.

**New API / Objects about Conferences**

You can now lock, unlock, delegate a Conference. Have talking time info and manage recording (start, stop, pause, resume)

**All examples updated**

All examples have been updated to use this new LTS version and this new logging abstration.

### API update in details:

**Bubbles service:**

-   `ConferenceRecordingStart`: **new** The Start recording command initiates a recording of a conference for the user whom sent the request.
-   `ConferenceRecordingStop`: **new** The Stop recording command stops a recording of a conference for the user whom sent the request.
-   `ConferenceRecordingPause`: **new** The Pause recording command pauses a recording of a conference for the user whom sent the request.
-   `ConferenceRecordingResume`: **new** The Resume recording command resumes a recording of a conference for the user whom sent the request.

**InstantMessaging service:**

-   `CanSendMessageWithHighUrgencyToConversation`: **new** (by id) To know if it's possible to send a message in a conversation in High Urgency mode.(i.e. Emergency message)
-   `CanSendMessageWithHighUrgencyToConversation`: **new** (by conversation)

**Bubble object:**

**Contact object:**

-   `IsAlertNotificationEnabled`: **new** Is user subscribed to "Rainbow Alert Offer". Only returned if retrieved user data corresponds to logged in user or if logged in user is in the same company than the retrieved user.

### \[2.5.2\] - STS - 2021-10-20

---

### Enhancements / Fixes:

**AutoReconnection service:**

-   This service can now use previous credentials for auto reconnection purpose if the user token is no more valid. (optional using **UsePreviousLoginPwd** property - **True** by default).
-   This service can now be used also to **start login process** using previous credentials (using user token first and then login/pwd if **UsePreviousLoginPwd** property is set).
-   The reconnection is automatically performed if the user credentials or user token has been accepted at least once by the server. In previous release, it was necessary to have at least a full initialization process performed. But this step could failed if the server is in trouble or if the network connection used is not very stable.
-   This service try always to resume XMPP stream (if set/enabled) in reconnection or login process.

**SdkError object**

-   **ResponseStatus** property is now set to **ResponseStatus.None** by default (before is was **ResponseStatus.Completed**)
-   **HttpStatusCode** property is now set to **0** by default (before is was **HttpStatusCode.OK** i.e. **200**)
-   These two updates make it possible to deal with errors more effectively: due to network problems, errors returned by the server or errors reported by the SDK itself (exceptions or incorrect parameters)

**SdkIncorrectUseError object**

-   **ErrorDetailsData** property has been added because details can be set by the server to better understand the error.

**Server Errors list**

-   A full list of possible errors returnd by the server is now available in the documentation.

### API update in details:

***AutoReconnection service***:

-   `IsStarted`: **new** (Property) To know if this service has started or not
-   `UsePreviousLoginPwd`: **new** (Property) To use previous credentials if the user token can no more be used by the service for auto reconnection purpose

### \[2.5.1\] - STS - 2021-09-29

---

### Enhancements / Fixes:

**Single Sign On (SSO):**

-   Add methods to permit SSO (SAML and Open ID Connect are both supported). The multiplatform example use them to allow SSO in Windows, Android or iOS environment

**"AutoReconnection" service:**

-   Once first connection and first initalization are performed, this new service (if enabled) will automatically try to reconnect to the server when the connection is lost.
-   Network interfaces are checked to ensure attempts are performed only when at least one is operational and connected to a network.
-   It's possible to set the maximum number of attempts before this service stops and even define a specific delay between each attempt.
-   Each attempt uses the user token. This token is also automatically renew at its half-life by this service until it's no more possible (event **TokenExpired** is raised)

**Stream Management (XEP-0198): (Alpha version)**

-   This new service (if enabled and if even pipe mode is set to XMPP) permits to reconnect to the XMPP server faster (using "resume" feature)
-   Once connected again , the client receives only stanza (i.e. messages, presences, ...) not received between the disconnection and the reconnection.
-   So all data cache internally used in the SDK is not cleared when this mode is enabled and the resume succeeded
-   It's still a work in progress so it must not be used yet in production.
-   At term, the support of this XEP will allow to have Push Notification in Android and iOS environment.

**Fixes:**

-   Login was not stored in cache when using connection with token
-   Server could not answer a valid JSON string (in maintenance mode for example) so cathc exception when trying to parse result error.

### Focus on Mutli-platform UI component

Still a work in progress but now an accurate milestone can be provided to have first UI components available for Android, iOS, Windows and MacOs: October / November.

For example the "MessageStream" component will allow to send / receive messages for the specified conversation. The layout and features available will be is nearly the same than the official Web / Desktop client (about IM purpose) like you can see in this 3 screenshots:

[Web / Desktop client](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/MultiPlatformApplication/images/MessageStream-WebClient.png)

[SDK C# - On Windows (UWP)](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/MultiPlatformApplication/images/MessageStream-CSharp-UWP.png)

[SDK C# - On Android](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/MultiPlatformApplication/images/MessageStream-CSharp-Android.png)

More info about this actual work in progress [here](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/MultiPlatformApplication).

### Fix / Enhancement:

-   **XMPP XEP-0153** (vCard-Based Avatars): standard presence message was not taken into account when receiving node with this namespace "vcard-temp:x:update". It could lead to have an incoreect Contact Presence or/and incorrect Contact Aggregated Presence
-   Fix: Connection / disconnection troubles in some race conditions
-   Fix: When option "mark automatically message as read" is set, avoid to mark message as read when they are sent by the current user using another device

### Focus on samples

Two new samples have been added:

-   **Mass Provisioning**: [sample here](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/MassProvisioning)

This sample is based on this scenario: An organization admin needs to manage several University with a lot of Students and some Teachers. Each Teacher has several Classrooms (i.e Bubbles) with a certain numbre of Students

For each University a Company is created with a Company Admin.

This Company Admin is used to create all teachers and all Students of the University.

Then using each Teacher, Classrooms are created and Students are assigned to each Classroom.

It takes less than 11 minutes to create a Univertisty, (i.e. a Company) with 1 Company Admin, 912 Students, 33 Teachers with 6 Classrooms by teacher and 25 students in each classroom.

This sample also demonstrates how to use asynchronous methods of the SDK API in a synchronous way.

-   **Multiplatform application**: [sample here](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/MultiPlatformApplication)

This sample demonstrates how to use the C# SDK to create iOS, Android and UWP (Windows) applications sharing more than 98% on common code.

It is based on MVVM architecture and we plan add step by step all features available in current iOS / Android application. So stay tuned :)

[Screenshot here](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/blob/master/images/MultiplatformApplication.png?raw=true)

Allow to log on the server in 2 steps: (To use only for advanced cases)

-   First for authentication purpose (with `LoginWithoutEventPipe` or `LoginWithTokenWithoutEventPipe`)
-   Then to connect to the event pipe (with `LoginToEventPipe`) Between these 2 steps, it's possible to use any methods using RESt API but until event pipe connection is performed no events will be received from the server (IM message, presence, etc ...)

***Application root service***: **updated**

-   `GetApplicationTokenFromCache`: **new** To get all info about the ApplicationToken object used as authentication purpose with the Rainbow Server.

### Capabilities: **added**

New capability has been added. Related services have been updated to take it into account.

-   `RecordingConversation` **new** To know if the user can record conversation in WebRTC

### Event Mode: **added**

A new event mode has been added to the two already existing:

-   `SDKEventMode.XMPP`: to use XMPP protocol for eventings purpose (default).
-   `SDKEventMode.S2S`: to use "server to server" (S2S) architexture for eventings purpose.

The new one `SDKEventMode.NONE` permits to used the SDK without any eventings. Very usefull if you use this SDK to perform only REST requests.

### New features

A new component **[Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.Common/)** has been created.

It's a mulitplatform component (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, ...) which provide new optional services.

The first release permits to easily manage Avatars of Contacts or Bubbles (using Rainbow.Common.Avatars service). It downloads them automatically (avatar deleted, updated by end-users) and stored them locally for reuse purpose. If a bubble has not a specific avatar, this service create automatically it using Avatars members.

This package includes also an ImageTools library which can re-used for other needs.

The [WebRtcControl Sample](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/Windows_WPF/WPF_WebRtcControl) used to demonstrate WebRtc in Peer To Peer context has been updated to use this new package to display avatar of the peer.

### Dependencies:

-   `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt` v6.8 is now used (instead of v6.7.1)

### Capabilities: updated / added

## \[1.22.0.0\] - 2021-02-18

---

### Dependencies:

-   `NLog` v4.7.7 is now used (instead of v4.7.2)
-   `RestSharp` v106.11.7 is now used (instead of v106.11.4)

### Robustness:

-   Login process fail if the SDK cannot get Company info of the current user

### New features

Several objects/services have been added to manage WebRTC signaling process (SDP, Ice Candidate, etc ...) using Jingle Message. Medias ARE NOT managed by the SDK.

It necessary to use another package to offer full WebRtc features (so adding MEdia and using this SDK for the signaling process)

A first release of this kind of package is available: [Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.Wpf.WebRtcControl](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.Wpf.WebRtcControl/). It allows WebRtc (Audio, Video, Sharing) in Peer To Peer for WPF application

A full sample using this control can be found here: \[WebRtcControl Sample\] (https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/Windows\_WPF/WPF\_WebRtcControl)

### Roadmap

A focus will be done to provide reuseable UI controls to create easily application using these them:

-   Avatar : to display easily Contact avatar with presence /counters, to display easily Bubble avatar
-   RecentConversations: To display a resume of last conversation ( avatars, last message, ...)
-   ConversationStream: To display the conversation, to read / send message, share/get files ...
-   Systray: Systray integration
-   NotificationWindow
-   ...

To do this the CSharp SDK will be splitted with several packages:

-   SDK (Core): the current one - multi-platform
-   SDK WPF: UI Controls (Like WebRtcControl) for for windows (using WPF)
-   SDK MacOS: UI Controls for MacOs (using Xamarin)
-   SDK Android: UI Controls for Android (using Xamarin)
-   SDK iOS: UI Controls for iOS using Xamarin)

A full sample (for each platfrom) with all UI controls will be available to demonstrate their usage.

Each time a full setup will be available (and the way to create it)

First step will target is Windows using WPF. Then MacOS.

Before to offer same things for Android / iOS, XMPP Stream management will be added in the SDK (core) first since it permits to have a better way to handle disconnection problems

***Major Update - log4net package no more used***

`NLog` is now used as logging module and replaces `log4net` package in this release.

It's not possible to use rolling file for log purpose in MacOS using `log4net` package and this package is no more maintained since November 2017.

It's why `NLog` 4.7.2 has been choosen to replace it.

In consequence, the way to log information has changed. You need to change your code like this:

-   `using log4net;` must be replaced by 'using NLog;'
-   `DebugFormat`, `InfoFormat`, `WarnFormat` and `ErrorFormat` must be replaced by `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.
-   `ILog log` must be replaced by `Logger log`

The configuration file and the initialisation step has changed too. Full documentation available [here](/#/documentation/doc/sdk/csharp/guides/130_application_logging)

***Major Update - WebSocket4Net package no more used***

`WebSocketSharp-netstandard` is now used as WebSocket multi-platform purpose and replaces `WebSocket4Net`.

On MacOS, `WebSocket4Net` doesn't well manage network disconnection. At minimum, a delay of one minute was necessary to know if the network was disconnected.

This impact only the way to manage connection if you are using a proxy. `Application.SetWebProxy` and `Application.SetWebProxy` no more exist. The method `Application.SetWebProxyInfo` must be used instead.

***Major Update - dependencies up to date***

All packages references used have been updated to use the last version available:

-   `Newtonsoft.Json` 12.0.3 (10.0.1 before)
-   `RestSharp` 106.11.4 (106.6.10 before)
-   `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt` 6.7.1 (5.4.0 before)

Same code than before can be used - only a property must be set to switch between event mode.

In S2S event mode a callback URL (also called Webhook) must be defined and you must use a web server.

Full documentation available [here](https://hub.openrainbow.com/#/documentation/doc/sdk/csharp/guides/035_events_mode)

Restriction of use available [here](https://hub.openrainbow.com/#/documentation/doc/sdk/csharp/guides/025_methods_and_events_available) and [here](https://hub.openrainbow.com/#/documentation/doc/sdk/csharp/guides/038_restriction_of_use).
