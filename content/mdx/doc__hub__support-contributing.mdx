Support and contributions guides

## Support and contributions guides

---

This guide describes how you can find help when developing on Rainbow and how you can contribute to help us delivering better software.

### Support

---

Depending on your need, here is how you can be supported.

#### Need support when developing

If you have questions on how to use our SDKs or APIs, use our [developer's community forums](https://support.openrainbow.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/115000150070-Hub-Support-Community) to post your requests in order to share the answers to all developers.

A good practice is to :

-   **Give us the context**: Which API or SDK you didn't succeed to use. On which platform, etc...
    
-   **Explain you case**: Give you some details on what you want to do.
    
-   **Add an extract of your existing code**: Give a a code snippet of the part of code that don't work.
    

#### Need support when finding an issue

Depending the type of Rainbow SDK version used by your application (either STS or LTS), the support path is different:

-   **LTS** is our **stable** version stream meaning we provide official support for these versions,
-   **STS** is our **unstable** version stream, providing latest features, we provide limited support for these version.

*Refer to [SDK Supported Versions](/docs/hub/lts-support-sdk-version) for details about our Rainbow SDK support policy.*

##### Issue found in a Rainbow SDK STS version

If you think you found an issue in a Rainbow SDK STS version:

-   verify you use the currently released Rainbow SDK STS version. If this is not the case, update to the current STS version and check if issue still exists,
-   gather the information listed in the *Required information for a suspected issue* paragraph below and every detail that is susceptible to ease investigation of the issue,
-   post the suspected issue description and information to our [Developer's Community Forum](https://support.openrainbow.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/115000150070). Our team of experts will do their best to analyze and answer to your post. If the issue if confirmed, a fix will be included in a future STS version.

##### Issue found in a Rainbow SDK LTS version

If you think you found an issue in a Rainbow SDK LTS version:

-   verify you use the officially supported Rainbow SDK LTS version. If this is not the case, update to the current LTS version and check if issue still exists,
-   gather the information listed in the *Required information for a suspected issue* paragraph below and every detail that is susceptible to ease investigation of the issue,
-   contact our ALE Support Team: by email support@openrainbow.com, with Rainbow by sending a message to our bot Emily. After a first analysis, a ticket will be opened and an answer will be provided in a short delay. If a fix is needed, an update of the current LTS version including the fix will be released.

##### Required information for a suspected issue

You will need to give us some additionnal information about the problem encountered:

-   **The context of the issue**, with some information on your use case and your environment.
    
-   **The operation done** which is the API or SDK method you are calling with a little snippet of your code that can reproduce the issue.
    
-   **The result observed** generated by the SDK or API.
    

Here is a summary of information to add to your ticket to help us understanding and fixing the issue.
