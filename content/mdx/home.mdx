## Success stories

![Rave - Logo](/static/media/rave-logo.ebfed823275fa1a5cb40.jpg)

Successfully managing an emergency requires coordination and cooperation from many different stakeholders, from the individuals on site who first encounter the emergency, to the 911 dispatcher who takes the call, to the first responder who reports to the scene. Rave and ALE are dedicated to breaking down the silos preventing effective communication and improve the interoperability between schools and public safety in order to create safer campuses and save lives.

COO, Rave Mobile Safety

This new infrastructure has enabled us to simplify the sharing and administration of our information systems, as well as to secure our two Data Centers through the implementation of a business continuity plan. We were able to deploy new services such as videoconference, IP deskphone and IoT for our internal needs and for the needs of users.
