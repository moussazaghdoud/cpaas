Connect to Rainbow

LTS release 2.6.XPublished on 2021-12-13

## Connect to Rainbow server

### Prerequisites

---

To connect to Rainbow Server, you need first to have an `applicationID` and a `secretKey` from the [developers website](/).

See first [Getting Started](/docs/sdk/csharp) if it's not the case.

Then you need to have a valid account (i.e. a login and a password).

You also need to know how events and callback are managed in C# and also know how to use the SDKResult object. If it's not the case read first this [guide](/docs/sdk/csharp)

### Events to handle

---

In order to follow correctly the login process, you have to handle several events from the Rainbow.Application object:

-   `AuthenticationFailed`: raised when the authentication has failed - bad login/pwd and/or bad `applicationID` and a `secretKey`
-   `AuthenticationSucceeded`: raised when the authentication has succeeded
-   `ConnectionStateChanged`: raised when the connection stated has changed (`ConnectionState.Disconnected, ConnectionState.Connecting, ConnectionState.Connected`)
-   `InitializationPerformed`: one connected this event is raised when the SDK is fully initialized.

It will be necessary to wait the event `InitializationPerformed` before to use the SDK and not just the event `ConnectionStateChanged` with the status `ConnectionState.Connected` because internally the SDK needs to get minimal information from the server to be ready.

For example, the SDK needs to get features and settings available for the current user before to be fully operationnal. It's done once the SDK is connected.

### Login process

---

Find here the full code to manage correctly the login process in a Console application.

```csharp
using Rainbow;

// Define objects
String appId = ""; // To set according your settings
String appSecretKey = ""; // To set according your settings
String hostName = "openrainbow.com"; // To set according your settings

String login = ""; // To set according your settings
String password = ""; // To set according your settings

// We will use aynschronous login method, so we  use the Boolean to quit program only if :
// - the authentication failed
// - the initialization has been performed
// - or we are disconnected
Boolean endProgram = false;  

// Create Rainbow.Application object
RbApplication = new Application();

// Set events that we want to follow
RbApplication.AuthenticationFailed += RbApplication_AuthenticationFailed; // This method will be called when the authentication process will fail
RbApplication.AuthenticationSucceeded += RbApplication_AuthenticationSucceeded; // This method will be called when the authentication process will succeed
RbApplication.ConnectionStateChanged += RbApplication_ConnectionStateChanged; // This method will be called when the Connection State will change
RbApplication.InitializationPerformed += RbApplication_InitializationPerformed; // This method will be called when the Initialization process will succeed

// Set global configuration info
RbApplication.SetApplicationInfo(appId, appSecretKey);
RbApplication.SetHostInfo(hostName);

// Start login
RbApplication.Login(login, password); 

// => Here, the code continues immediately since the Login method is asynchronous.

// We need loop until we want to end the program.
// If this loop is not done, the program will exit before the login process has ended - due to error (bad pwd for example) or on success
do
{
    Thread.Sleep(100);
} while (!endProgram);


// Now we define methods which will be called by events defined previously

void RbApplication_InitializationPerformed(object? sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Here we just log that the initialization has been performed
    Console.WriteLine($"InitializationPerformed");

    // We can now quit for this sample
    endProgram = true;
}

void RbApplication_ConnectionStateChanged(object? sender, Rainbow.Events.ConnectionStateEventArgs e)
{
    // Here we just log connection state in the console
    Console.WriteLine($"ConnectionStateChanged: [{e.ConnectionState.State}]");

    if (e.ConnectionState.State == Rainbow.Model.ConnectionState.Disconnected)
    {
        // We can now quit for this sample
        endProgram = true;
    }
}

void RbApplication_AuthenticationSucceeded(object? sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"AuthenticationSucceeded");
}

void RbApplication_AuthenticationFailed(object? sender, Rainbow.Events.SdkErrorEventArgs e)
{
    // Authentication failed - we display in the console the reason
    Console.WriteLine($"AuthenticationFailed\r\n[{e.SdkError}");

    // We can now quit for this sample
    endProgram = true;
}
```
