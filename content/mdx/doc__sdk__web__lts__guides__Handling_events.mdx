Handling Events

LTS release 4.0.0Publiée le 2022-12-21

## Handling events

Rainbow Web SDK is based in its nature on the asynchronous calls to the servers which, depending on the location, can take more or less milliseconds. It is therefore crucial to make sure the data you manipulate in your application is correctly handled by the code. In terms of Rainbow Web SDK, events represent various actions that are being done somewhere away from the local machine. For example, when someone sends you a message, you want to receive a notification that informs you about it. Also, events come in handy when you want to make sure that Rainbow server received your request - i.e. it can confirm that the bubble you wanted to deactivate has been really deactivated on the server side.

Rainbow Web SDK provides a number of such events in its multiple services. You might want to see the events linked to the messages sent, audio and video conferences created, channels or favorite conversations- the choice is yours. Rainbow produces and event (or "fires" it) whenever something important happens on the server side.

### Compatibility

To ensure the fullest possible compatibility of the events, **Rainbow Web SDK** uses the vanilla (native) JavaScript events. It allows us to adapt to the needs of the third-party developers by providing a low-level functionality that can be easily understood by all the JavaScript frameworks and environments.

It also means, that the methods supported until this moment will not be available. AngularJS' **broadcast** and jQuery's **dispatchEvent** functions are no longer supported by **Rainbow Web SDK**. Also `useAngularEvents()` method is no longer available.

### Technical Details

Handling native JavaScript events is simple in its nature: we are going to use **EventTarget.addEventListener()** method.

**EventTarget** is a DOM interface that can receive events. In case of **Rainbow Web SDK** this element is always set to **document**.

General rule for listening to Rainbow events is therefore:

```
document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.EVENT_NAME, doSomethingWithTheEvent())
```

### Event Detail

Starting from version 1.64.0 of the **Rainbow Web SDK** all the events parameters (if such exist on a given event) will be carried in the **detail** property of an event.

There are two types of events: those who carry only one parameter with them and those that have two and more parameters.

One example of a single-parameter event is `rainbowSDK.conversations.RAINBOW_ONCONVERSATIONCHANGED`. Here is how you handle such events:

```
let onConversationChanged = function(event) {

    // as noted in the documentation, RAINBOW_ONCONVERSATIONCHANGED carries only one parameter: conversationID:

    let conversationId = event.detail;

    // do something with the event
}

// add event listener
document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.conversations.RAINBOW_ONCONVERSATIONCHANGED, onConversationChanged)
```

As for the multi-parameter events, situation remains equally simple. For instance, to recover the parameters of `rainbowSDK.im.RAINBOW_ONNEWIMMESSAGERECEIVED` event, you need to apply the following handler:

```
let onNewMessageReceived = function(event) {

    // as noted in the documentation, RAINBOW_ONNEWIMMESSAGERECEIVED carries three parameters: Message, Conversation and CC. Let's retrieve them:

    let message = event.detail.message;
    let conversation = event.detail.conversation;
    let cc = event.detail.cc;

    // do something with the event

}

// add event listener
document.addeventlistener(rainbowSDK.im.RAINBOW_ONNEWIMMESSAGERECEIVED, onNewMessageReceived)
```
