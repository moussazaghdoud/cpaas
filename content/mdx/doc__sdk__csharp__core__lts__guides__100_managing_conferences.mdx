## Managing conferences

This guide explains how to manage conferences:

-   Check conference status: in progress or not
-   Get the list of participants and talkers
-   Mute/unmute a participant,
-   Raise hand, lower hand, or all hands
-   Remove a participant
-   List the media used and the people who used them.
-   Manage conference recording
-   Manage your own media

Most of the information can only be obtained if the user using the SDK actually participates in the conference - either by using another device (via any UCaaS application), or by using an SDK that allows connection via WebRTC to the conference (for example, using the C# SDK and the [Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Desktop package](/docs/sdk/csharp)).

### Check permissions

---

First thing to do, it's to check if the user can make conferences. For this `IsConferenceAllowed()` method must be used from `Conferences` service.

### Check conference status

---

To follow the status of conference in progress use:

-   `ConferenceUpdated` event when a conference information is updated (so the conference is in progress / has started)
-   `ConferenceRemoved` event when a conference is removed/finished
-   `ConferenceRejected` event when a conference has been rejected by the current user\` object (same event for PSTN or WebRTC conference).

You have also this methods:

-   `CheckConferencesInProgressAsync()`: The result permits to know if there as least one conference in progress.
-   `GetAllConferences()`: To get conferences list in progress from the cache
-   `GetFullSnapshotAsync()` or `GetSnapshotAsync()` using a bubble peer to know (if any) conference information

### Get the list of participants and talkers

---

You have event to get those information:

-   `ConferenceParticipantsUpdated` event when at least one participant has been added, removed, updated
-   `ConferenceTalkersUpdated` event when at least one telker has been added, removed, updated

But also methods:

-   `GetParticipants()`
-   `GetTalkers()`

### Mute/unmute a participant, raise hand, lower hand, or all hands

---

Use `MuteOrUnmuteParticipantAsync()` to mute / unmute a participant. You must be a conference moderator if you wish to manage this for a participant other than yourself.

Use `RaiseHandAsync()`, `LowerHandAsync()` to raise / lower hand. You must be a conference moderator if you wish to manage this for a participant other than yourself.

Use `LowerAllHandsAsync()` to lower all hands as moderator.

### Remove a participant

---

As moderator, use `DropParticipantAsync` to remove a participant from the conference.

### List the media used and the people who used them.

---

You have event to get those information:

-   `ConferenceMediaPublicationsUpdated` event when at least one Media Publication has been added, removed, updated
-   `ConferenceMediaServicesUpdated` event when at least one Media Service has been added, removed, updated
-   `ConferenceMediaPublicationSubscribersUpdated` event when at least one Subscriber to a Media Publication has been added, removed, updated

But also methods:

-   `GetMediaPublications()`
-   `GetMediaServices()`
-   `GetMediaPublications()`
-   `GetMediaPublications()`

### Manage conference recording

---

To know the conference recording status use the `ConferenceUpdated` event. The propety **RecordStatus** of **Conference** object permits to know if the conference is recorded - status possible are off/on/pause.

As moderator, you can use this methods:

-   `StartRecordingAsync()`
-   `StopRecordingAsync()`
-   `PauseRecordingAsync()`
-   `ResumeRecordingAsync()`

### Manage your own media

---

This chapter describes events / methods **only useful** if you are connecting to the conference using WebRTC (for example, using [Rainbow.CSharp.SDK.WebRTC.Desktop package](/docs/sdk/csharp))

To be more precise, this methods are used by these package to handle medias:

-   `AddAudioAsync()`: To add audio in a conference if this media was not already used by the current user
-   `SubscribeToMediaPublicationAsync()`: gives the possibility to a user participating in a webrtc conference to subscribe to a **MediaPublication**
-   `SubscribeToMediaServiceAsync()`: gives the possibility to a user participating in a webrtc conference to subscribe to a **MediaService**

### Examples

---

You can take a look to several examples available [here](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/SDK%20V3.X/README.md)
