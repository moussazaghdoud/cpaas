## Using Config

---

Rainbow Web SDK configuration allows the developers to provide a more fine-grained experience to their users. It is also enabling the customization of the project that uses the SDK.

This article covers two basic ways of Rainbow Web SDK configuration

---

### Method 1: Config File

While loading the SDK, you can pass a JavaScript object as an argument. Here's a quick snippet demonstrating the usage of the config object:

```javascript
const rainbowConfig = {
    verboseLog: false, // Turn on/off all the logs linked to the SDK
    measurePerformance: false, // Add performance measurement points while loading the SDK
    videoQuality: "1080p", // Chose default broadcasted video quality 
    credentials: {
        appID: "",
        appSecret: "",
        host: "openrainbow.com"
    }, // use the credentials 
    logs: { // use fine-grained logs control (verboseLog needs to be true)
        contactService: true, // set to false to block all contactService logs
        xmppMessages: true, // set to false to block all XMPP messages 
        xmppService: true, // set to false to block xmppService logs
        conversationService: true, // set to false to block conversationService logs
        presence: true, // set to false to block presence logs

    }
}

rainbowSDK.load(rainbowConfig);
```

The presented structure of `rainbowConfig` object above is loaded by the SDK by default. If you want to keep all the properties as they are, but change one - for instance verboseLog - you can just mention only verboseLog in the config object:

```javascript
const rainbowConfig = {
    verboseLog: true
}
rainbowSDK.load(rainbowConfig);
```

### Method 2: Config Service

You can also use `ConfigService` provided by Rainbow Web SDK, please have a look at the documentation of the service to find out what APIs are available with more details on the implementation.
