## Installation for Mac

This guide will help you setup your development environment if you are using a macOS computer. The create a desktop application for Mac, you need to use `Xamarin.Mac`. It is the Mac equivalent to a `WinForm`.

### Requirements

To develop an application with Xamarin.Mac, you will need :

-   a computer running on macOS High Sierra (10.13)+
-   XCode 9+
-   the latest version of Visual Studio for Mac

> To run an application built with Xamarin.Mac you can use a Mac computer running macOS 10.7 or higher.

### Install Visual Studio for Mac

---

-   Install [Visual Studio for Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/installation?view=vsmac-2019). Be sure to add the *macOS (Cocoa)* platform target during installation.

---

-   After the installation is complete, you will have a message telling you that you need to install [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) in order to compile your code.
-   You will need an Apple ID to download it on the App Store.
-   Once the download is over, you can launch the XCode so that it can install some additional components.

XCode will be used to design the UI of your Xamarin.Mac app. To open it, you need to right-click on the file named `Main.storyboard` and select "*Open with XCode Interface Builder*". From then, you will be able to add components to your Interface.
