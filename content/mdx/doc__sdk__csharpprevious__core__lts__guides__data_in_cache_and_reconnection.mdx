# Documentation

Data in cache

LTS release 2.6.XPubliée le 2021-12-13

# Data storage and connection / reconnection

## Prerequisite

You must first know how to connect and manage auto-reconnection service using the SDK:

-   [Connect to Rainbow](/docs/sdk/csharp).
-   [Auto Reconnection](/docs/sdk/csharp).

## Introduction

The SDK cannot retrieve all data "at once" once connected to the server. In addition, this connection can be interrupted and the data must be synchronized again.

This guide aims:

-   To list what data is stored
-   To understand when they are available
    -   they depend on the user's license
    -   they depend on the options used in the SDK
-   To understand the connection and reconnection problem to synchronize this data

The last chapter, via code examples, shows how to handle all of this.

## Connection / Reconnection (REST and Event Pipe)

The SDK is connected to the Rainbow server using two different channels:

-   REST API (HTTP requests): asynchonous connection based on secutiry token with a "time to live"
-   XMPP (or eventually S2S) event pipe: web socket connection which needs permanent connection.

From a global point of view, REST API is used for static data and event pipe for dynamic data (presence, instant messaging, ...)

To be fully operational, the SDK must create a valid link on both channels (authenticated, connected) and have enough data/information (license, settings, ...) after connection or a reconnection.

As developper, you only know if the SDK is connected or not using event [`ConnectionStateChanged`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Application.ConnectionStateChanged) event in [`Application`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service but you cannot know which one specificalyy is connected/disconnected.

To give more details, event pipe disconnection occurs more often. For example, if there is a network trouble for a short period, the event pipe will be disconnected but not the REST API channel.

And usually, if the REST API channel is disconnected, the event pipe is also disconnected.

## Bubbles and how they are managed

To receive or send messages or to get dynamic information about a Bubble (for example that there is a conference in progress), the SDK must first join it. It also called a bubble affiliation.

The SDK can do it:

-   only when the event pipe connection is operational
-   and join Bubbles one by one.

So, the more bubbles you have, the longer it takes to join them all.

## Contacts presence

To know the **Aggregated Presence** (also called **Unified Ptesence**) of one contact, the SDK must first receive information of each of his devices:

-   One for each client used: Rainbow Web client, Rainbow Mobile Phone (Adnroid and/or iOS, ...)
-   Optionnaly, one to manage his telephony device (Rainbow Hub or OXO/OXE)
-   Optionnaly, one to manage his calendar presence (Google Calendar, Office 365, ...)
-   Optionnaly, one to manage his Team presence (Google Calendar, Office 365, ...)

Now multiply all these by the number of contats in the roster, and you can see that there is a lot of Presence messages to handle. And this messages are received only when the event pipe is connected.

Further more, presence

## Telephony data

To ensure to have accurate information, Telephony settings are obtained using the the event pipe. So we must be first connected to it.

Once connected, the SDK waits to receive for the telephony system its status before to ask more information.

## SDK Events

The SDK provides a way to know:

1.  when the user is connected/authenticated on both channels, [`ConnectionStateChanged`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Application.ConnectionStateChanged) event in [`Application`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service is raised with a state equals to [`ConnectionState.Connected`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Model.ConnectionState.Connected)
2.  when enough data are retrieved/refreshed, [`InitializationPerformed`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Application.InitializationPerformed) event in [`Application`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service is raised.
3.  Each time a Bubble has been joined, [`BubbleAffiliationChanged`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Bubbles.BubbleAffiliationChanged) event in [`Bubbles`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service is raised.
4.  when all Bubbles have been joined (and even if current user has no bubble), [`BubbleAffiliationsPerformed`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Bubbles.BubbleAffiliationsPerformed) event in [`Bubbles`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service is raised.

**Note:**

-   You can start to use the SDK after the step 2 (before it's now allowed). It you need to use a Bubble, ensure to have received event [`BubbleAffiliationChanged`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Bubbles.BubbleAffiliationChanged) for this Bubble or wait for event [`BubbleAffiliationsPerformed`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Bubbles.BubbleAffiliationsPerformed)
-   The delay between step 2 and step 4 is direclty dependent of the number of active bubbles.
-   After step 2, other data are retrieved, see the list in a next chapter for full details.
-   If at least one channel is disconnected, [`ConnectionStateChanged`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Application.ConnectionStateChanged) event in [`Application`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service is raised with a state equals to [`ConnectionState.Disconnected`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Model.ConnectionState.Disconnected).

**To resume**:

-   If you don't have to manage a lot of Bubbles, using event [`InitializationPerformed`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Application.InitializationPerformed) is enough.
-   If you have to manage a lot of of Bubbles, uses event [`BubbleAffiliationsPerformed`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Bubbles.BubbleAffiliationsPerformed) to ensure that the SDK has already joined all of them.
-   If you have to manage a lot of of Bubbles but the connection/reconnection delay is very critical for you, uses event [`BubbleAffiliationChanged`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Bubbles.BubbleAffiliationChanged) to check which Bubbles have been already joined before to use them. You can also use the method [`IsBubbleAffiliated`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Bubbles.IsBubbleAffiliated\(String\))

About Presence, you have in [`Contacts`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service 2 events to use if you want to manage them:

-   [`ContactPresenceChanged`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Contacts.ContactPresenceChanged): Event triggered when the presence of one of a user's devices is modified.
-   [`ContactAggregatedPresenceChanged`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Contacts.ContactAggregatedPresenceChanged): Event triggered when the aggregated presence of one user is modified.

About Telephony, you have several events in [`Telephony`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service to manage this features.

## Data stored and when they are retrieved / refreshed

The array below provides these information:

-   By service, data which are stored in the cache (in memory)
-   Some data are retrieved only if the current user has a correct license and (if any) a property in [`Restrictions`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Application.Restrictions) has been set in the SDK. Examples:
    -   **Turn servers** are retrieved, if the current user has the license to use WebRTC and if [`Restrictions.UseWebRTC`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.UseWebRTC) has been set to true.
    -   **Capabilities** of the [`FileStorage`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service are automatically retrieved if the current user has the license to use it.
-   After a disconnection, some data are **`Removed`** from the cache - it depends on which channel there is the disconnection: REST API or Event pipe.
-   After a connection or reconnection, some data are **Refreshed BEFORE** [`InitializationPerformed`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Application.InitializationPerformed) event in **Application** service is raised.
-   After a connection or reconnection, some data are **Refreshed AFTER** [`InitializationPerformed`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Application.InitializationPerformed) event in **Application** service is raised.
