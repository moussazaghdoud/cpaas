## Frequently asked questions

### What is the Rainbow for Developers ?

Rainbow for Developers is the ALE Communications Platform CPaaS (Communication Platform as a Service) dedicated to developers, ISV, Business Partners, IT and integrators who want to integrate Rainbow APIs to offer hybrid cloud communication services to their users and customers.

### What can I find here?

Rainbow for Developers is the dedicated portals for Rainbow developers. You will find documentation for our Rainbow SDKs and REST APIs and samples. This is also the place where you create, handle and monitor your applications.

### What are the prerequisites?

All you need to start your **developer's journey** is a Rainbow account. Once you have it (Rainbow sign-in is free), you can connect to Rainbow for Developers (follow this link: [LOG IN](/login)), register yourself as a developer to access our development platform and start using our SDK and APIs.

### How do I create my developer account?

First of all (if not already done), create a free Rainbow account, then sign-in to Rainbow for Developers with this account and self-register as a Rainbow developer.

### Is it free of charge?

Yes, when you connect your application to our dedicated Rainbow sandbox platform. Once your application is ready for production use, you can connect it to the Rainbow production platform. With our Pay As You Go offer, we give you a limited monthly free API calls. You pay for API usage exceeding these free API calls thresholds. A payment method has to be provided (either credit card or SEPA mandate). At any time, you can monitor your API consumption on Rainbow for Developers website.

### Are there monthly fees?

Registering as a Rainbow developer is free of charge as like as connecting your application to the Rainbow sandbox platform. Once your application is connected to the Rainbow production platform, billing is based on API consumption. Free API calls thresholds are offered each month. API usage can be monitored in real-time on Rainbow for Developers website.

### What is the difference between Sandbox and Production?

The Rainbow Sandbox Platform allows you to experiment and test your applications in "sandbox" mode without any risks and free of charge. The so called Production Platform is the real Rainbow platform that enables your applications to be officially available. When you activate the Sandbox account associated to your Rainbow developer account, you will get a dedicated password for this platfor per e-mail.
