Development on Sandbox

## Development on Sandbox

---

Our **Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers** is a testing environment that mimics the live Rainbow Production environment. It provides a secured space where you can test and develop your application without impacting any live Rainbow accounts.

The Sandbox platform offers the same level of Rainbow API features as the production platform except for some Business and Enterprise grade services.

By using Sandbox test accounts and their associated authentication credentials in your Rainbow application, you can test and debug without referencing any real Rainbow users and so avoid interactions with others real Rainbow users too.

The next sections describe in details how to create your Developer Sandbox account and how to use it.

### Sandbox platform for developers vs Production platform

---

Our Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers is a Rainbow environment similar to the Rainbow Production platform that can be used when developing your application. Only developers are allowed to access to this Sandbox platform.

The aim of that platform is to let you discover and try our Rainbow SDKs and APIs without disturbing real users on the production platform.

That's why this platform is independent of the Rainbow Production platform. So you can't interact with real users and consequently make mistake on your existing data, contacts, etc...

On that platform, you can create as many tests accounts as you want. This is useful if you want to develop and test your chat or collaboration use cases.

### Free of charge

---

The Rainbow Sandbox for developers is **"free of charge"** in order to let you familiarize with Rainbow.

When you're using this platform to develop your application, there is no accrued charge when calling Rainbow API or services.

The Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers may limit the usage of each API per day for security and performance reason.

### Developing on Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers

---

The following sections describe how to register and use your Sandbox developer account and how to create and connect your application to the Rainbow Sandbow platform for developers.

#### Activating your Sandbox developer account

For developing and testing your application with Rainbow using our Developers Sandbox platform, you need first to activate your sandbox account. Here is the procedure:

Step

Description

**Sign-in to Rainbow for Developers**

The first step is to sign-in to the [Rainbow for Developers login page](/login) with your Rainbow credentials.

**Activate your Sandbox account**

From the **Sandbox** section located in the left side menu, click on **Create your sandbox** button.  
This action will create your account on the Sandbox platform.

**Get your credentials**

Once activated, you will receive an email containing your Rainbow credentials for connecting to the Sandbox platform.

You have now activated your sandbox account.

#### Creating your test accounts

When you create your Rainbow sandbox account, a company is created with the name "Company of *<username>*". The Rainbow sandbox account is member and administrator of this personal company.

Test accounts can be created in this company. These will be visible only inside the company itself.

There are two options to create and manage test accounts on the Sandbox platform:

The easiest way is to **connect to the Rainbow sanbox web client** (the link can be found in the **Sandbox** page of Rainbow for Developers). You have to connect to the Rainbow sandbox web client using your sandbox credentials. Then, click on the "Administration" tab, then "MyCompany" / "Members".

The other option to manage test accounts on the Sandbox platform is **using the Rainbow CLI command line tool**:

Step

Description

**Install the Rainbow CLI**

The first step is to install our **Rainbow CLI** application for connecting to the Sandbox platform for developers.  
You need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) and then the [Rainbow CLI](/docs/sdk/cli/tutorials/Getting_started) package.

**Connect the Rainbow CLI**

Launch the command `rbw configure` to configure your Rainbow CLI application with the sandbox credentials received by email.  
Launch the command `rbw login` to connect to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers.

**Create your test accounts**

Once connected, to create test accounts, launch the command `rbw create user` like described in the guide [Managing test accounts](/docs/sdk/cli/tutorials/Managing_tests_accounts) to create a test account

**Use your tests accounts**

You can use or modify the accounts created either by using the Rainbow CLI application (use the command `rbw commands` to have the full list of available commands) or by using the Rainbow sandbox web client.

Your test accounts are now ready. Now, you need to register an application to connect to Rainbow.

#### Creating your application

You must have an application identifier and secret key to identify your application on the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers like on the Rainbow Production platform.

There are two ways to create and manage your applications on the Rainbow Sandbox platform.

The easiest way is to use the Rainbow for Developers **Sandbox** section. You need to click the "Connect to sandbox" button and to enter your sandbox account credentials in the login popup. Then the list of existing applications will be displayed (if any). You will be able to create, modify or delete sandbox applications.

The alternative way is to use the Rainbow CLI command line tool:

Step

Description

**Connect the Rainbow CLI**

Launch the command `rbw configure` to configure your Rainbow CLI application with the sandbox credentials received by email.  
Launch the command `rbw login` to connect to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers.

**Create your application**

Launch the command `rbw application create` to create an application.  
This application is automatically deployed and so can connect to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers.

**Get your application id**

To get your application id and secret key, use the commands `rbw applications` and `rbw application`.  
Read the guide [Managing applications](/docs/sdk/cli/tutorials/Managing_applications) to have more information.

Now that the application has been registered, the final step is to connect a test account to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers using the application id and secret key generated and through a SDK or the REST APIs.

#### Identifying your application

After registering your application, you need to identify it by using the associated **application key** and **secret key**.

The following table describes the procedure for each SDK or API:

Using

Task to do

[**Rainbow SDK for Web**](/web)

You need to replace the value of the parameters `strApplicationID`, `strApplicationSecret` of the API `initialize()` with your application information.  
Read the Rainbow SDK for Web [Adding application id and secret key](/docs/sdk/web) guide for more information.

[**Rainbow SDK for Android**](/android)

You need to replace the value of the parameters `applicationId`, `secretKey` of the API `initialize()` with your application information.  
Read the Rainbow SDK for Android [Getting Started](/docs/sdk/android) guide for more information.

[**Rainbow SDK for iOS**](/ios)

You need to add the `appID` and `appSecret` in application delegates method `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`.  
Read the Rainbow SDK for iOS [Getting Started](/docs/sdk/ios) guide for more information.

[**Rainbow SDK for CSharp**](/csharp)

You need to call `SetApplicationInfo()` method in `Application` object with `applicationId` and `applicationSecretKey`.  
Read the Rainbow SDK for CSharp [Getting Started](/docs/sdk/csharp) guide for more information.

[**Rainbow SDK for Node.JS**](/node)

You need to replace the value of the `appID`, `appSecret` in your configuration file with your application information.  
Read the Rainbow SDK for NodeJS [Getting Started](/docs/sdk/node) guide for more information.

[**REST API**](/apis)

You need to update the header `x-rainbow-app-auth` with your application information.  
Read the REST APIs [Connecting to Rainbow](/docs/rest/Connecting_to_Rainbow) guide for more information.

And finally, use your credentials to connect to Rainbow...

#### Connecting to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers

Finally, you need to connect to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers using one or your test accounts.

The following table describes the procedure for each SDK or API:

Using

Task to do

[**Rainbow SDK for Web**](/web)

Use the method `signin()` with your test account credentials

[**Rainbow SDK for Android**](/android)

Use the method API `signin()` with your test account credentials. 3rd parameter has to be set to `sandbox.openrainbow.com`

[**Rainbow SDK for iOS**](/ios)

Use the `kChangeServerURLNotification` with `sandbox.openrainbow.com`  
Read the Rainbow SDK for iOS [Getting Started](/docs/sdk/ios) guide for more information.

[**Rainbow SDK for CSharp**](/csharp)

Use the method `Login()` in `Application` object with your test account credentials.  
Read the Rainbow SDK for CSharp [Getting Started](/docs/sdk/csharp) guide to have more information.

[**Rainbow SDK for Node.JS**](/node)

Parameters `login` and `password` have to be filled with your test account credentials.  
Parameter `host` in configuration file have to be set to `sandbox.openrainbow.com`

[**REST API**](/apis)

Use the REST API [Login user](/api/authentication/index.html).  
with your test account credentials. Request have to be sent to host `sandbox.openrainbow.com`

If you did all these steps, you should now be ready to develop your application on the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers with your test accounts.

This procedure will help you connecting the Rainbow Desktop application to the Rainbow Sandbox platform for developers.

After having started the client at least one time, find and edit the following file:

On Windows:

```shell
%appdata%\Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise\Rainbow\Settings
```

On macOs:

```shell
~/Library/Application Support/Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise/Rainbow/Settings
```

The `Settings` file is an XML formatted file, see content example here:

```XML
{
  "handFreeInputDeviceName": "Microphone interne (Built-in)",
  "handFreeOutputDeviceName": "Haut-parleurs internes (Built-in)",
  "language": "fr",
  "secondarySpeakerUsed": "Haut-parleurs internes (Built-in)",

```

Add the following line:

```XML
"domain": "web-sandbox.openrainbow.com"
```

Be careful if the new line is not the last one, do not forget to add a coma at the end of line as shown in this example:

```XML
{
  "domain": "web-sandbox.openrainbow.com",
  "handFreeInputDeviceName": "Microphone interne (Built-in)",
  "handFreeOutputDeviceName": "Haut-parleurs internes (Built-in)",
  "language": "fr",
