# Documentation

Usage restrictions

LTS release 3.XPublished on 2025-03-17

## Usage restrictions

This SDK can be used to create:

-   Bots (for Windows Server, Linux Server)
-   Desktop applications (for Windows, MacOs, Linux)
-   Mobile Applications (for Android, IOs)
-   AR/VR application (using Unity)
-   And more ...

So according your needs, the way to use the SDK is different.

Perhaps in Bot context:

-   you don't want / have to store messages sent by it
-   you don't need to use an event pipe because you have to perform only administration tasks

Also if you are in a degugging phase, you want to log more details.

The [`Restrictions`](/docs/sdk/csharp) object from [`Application`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service is designed to tune the SDK according your needs.

The more restrictions you set, the more effective the SDK will be.

Below you will find details about most common properties. Read documentation of [`Restrictions`](/docs/sdk/csharp) object to have the full list.

### How to set Restrictions

To set restrictions, you have to set properties in the [`Restrictions`](/docs/sdk/csharp) object.

This must be done before to start the login process.

Code example:

```csharp
// Create Rainbow Application object
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Get Restrictions object
var myRestrictions = myApp.Restrictions;

// Now we can set restrictions according your needs

// To use WebRTC features - False by default
myApp.Restrictions.UseWebRTC = true;

// To send automatically a read receipt when a message is recevied - False by default
myApp.Restrictions.SendReadReceipt = true;

// etc ...
```

### Limit the use of some services

If you don't need to use some features/services (even if you have the licence), it's better to indicate if to the SDK.

-   [`UseBubbles`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.UseBubbles) property (**True** by default) to use Bubbles or not.
-   [`UseConferences`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.UseBubbles) property (**True** by default) to use Conferences or not.
-   [`UseHubTelephony`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.UseHybridTelephony) property (**True** by default) to use Hybrid Telephony or not.
-   [`UseHybridTelephony`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.UseHybridTelephony) property (**True** by default) to use Hybrid Telephony or not.
-   [`UseWebRTC`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.UseTelephony) property (**False** by default) to use WebRTC or not.
-   [`UseAlerts`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.UseTelephony) property (**False** by default) to use Alerts message service or not.

**NOTE:**

-   Alert messages service needs a specific licence
-   Alert messages service is not related to IM messages and [`MessageUrgencyType`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Enums.MessageUrgencyType) set as [`MessageUrgencyType.High`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Enums.MessageUrgencyType.High) (i.e. Urgent message)
-   For more details read documentation of [`Rainbow.Alerts`](/docs/sdk/csharp) service.

### Event mode restriction

Like described in details in another guide (Cf. [XMPP or Server to Server events mode](/docs/sdk/csharp)) you can select the event mode restriction between XMPP or S2S.

You have to set [`EventMode`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.EventMode) property according your needs.

[`SdkEventMode.XMPP`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Enums.SdkEventMode.XMPP) is used by default.

### Logging options

You have the possibility to have more or less logs according some options.

Logs about events:

-   [`LogEvent`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.LogEvent) if set to True (default value) to log all events which are raised/triggered by the SDK.
-   [`LogEventRaised`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.LogEvent) if set to True (default value) to log all events which should be raised/triggered or not by the SDK.
-   [`LogEventParameters`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.LogEventParameters) if set to True (default value) to log parameters of events which are raised/triggered by the SDK - **LogEvent** or **LogEventRaised** must be also true.
-   [`LogEventStackTrace`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.LogEventStackTrace) if set to True (default value) to log stack trace of events which are raised/triggered by the SDK - **LogEvent** or **LogEventRaised** must be also true.

Logs about REST requests:

-   [`LogRestRequest`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.LogRestRequest) if set to True (False by default) to log all REST requests (with or without servers error).
-   [`LogRestRequestOnError`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.LogRestRequestOnError) if set to True (default value) to log all REST requests with servers error.

Logs about Bubbles:

-   [`LogBubbleMembers`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.LogBubbleMembers) if set to True (False by default) to log also Members when a Bubble is loggued.

**NOTE:** It's possible to have anonymous log (default) or not using [`Util.SetLogAnonymously()`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Util.SetLogAnonymously\(Boolean\))

### Allow to send message to the current connected user of the SDK

In a BOT context, perhaps you want to send messages to the current connected user of the SDK. For this use [`LogRestRequestOnError`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.SendMessageToConnectedUser) property.

### Automatically send a read receipt

In a BOT context, perhaps you want to automatically send a read receipt for each message received. For this use [`SendReadReceipt`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.SendReadReceipt) property.

### Mobile application

If the SDK is used to create Mobile Application, it's **mandatory** to set [`MobileApplication`](/docs/sdk/csharp#Rainbow.Restrictions.MobileApplication) property to True.

It ensures to share a correct presence level to other user devices as a Mobile Application.
