# Interacting with users

Rainbow is called a relationship machine because by using our SDKs and APIs you can find users, bots and things, keep a link with each of them, make groups and interact with them in a unique way.

Additionally, you can create privileged relations with them that let you access to information such as their availability.  
Doing so let you build a lot of scenarios and could help you knowing the best way to reach them.

The Rainbow SDK for Web offers a lot of methods that will be covered in that guide to let you build and manage your relationships.

## Rainbow Knowledge

Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide.

Rainbow concepts

Details

The connected user

This is the logged user, in other words : you.  
The connected user have a set of specific methods which allow to change avatar, profile info, etc...

The user network

This is the list of users with whom the connected user shares his availability, such as his presence on the phone, his activity, etc..  
The network is empty by default and can grow by sending and accepting invitations to Rainbow users.  
This action is call joining the network.

A network user

A network user is a Rainbow user who is in the network of the connected user.

An network invitation

An invitation to join the network is a request that can be sent to any Rainbow users who can be found by the search engine.  
An invitation can be accepted or declined.  
When accepted, the user is added to the network or other user and inversely.  
When declined, the request is discarded.

The user lists

Users in Rainbow can be gathered by defining lists.  
Lists allow to categorize and organize your relations, friends, colleagues, bots, connected things, etc.

## Preamble

As indicated in the introduction, using Rainbow, you can interact with users, bots or things.

Having an interaction means:

-   Being able to discover any entities such a users, bots or things
    
-   Being able to dialog actively with them for example by making a video call with an user or receiving an instant message from a bot
    
-   Being able to keep a link to them (e.g. retrieving the conversation or creating groups)
    
-   And being able to get passive information from them such as their connection presence, phone presence, etc... Which means having a privileged relation.
    

The different kinds of interactions are described in the following paragraphs.

-   [Go to Users list](/docs/sdk/web)
