Restriction of use

LTS release 2.6.XPubliée le 2021-12-13

## Restriction of use

This SDK can be used to create:

-   Desktop applications (for Windows, MacOs, Linux)
-   Mobile Applications (for Android, IOs)
-   Bots (for Windows Server, Linux Server)

So, according the target, the way to use the SDK is different and must be set by using `Restrictions` object from `Application`.

By default restrictions are set to target in priority Desktop application.

### Mobile application restriction

---

If the SDK is used to create Mobile Application, it's necessary to specify it using `MobileApplication` property in `Restrictions` object. It ensures to share a correct presence level to other user devices.

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Set Mobile Application use (by default it's set to false)
myApp.Restrictions.MobileApplication = true;
```

### Avoid to send messages too big

---

To avoid to send message too big the restriction `MessageMaxLength` can be used. By default, it's set to 16384.

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Avoid to send message too big
myApp.Restrictions.MessageMaxLength = 512;
```

### Allow to receive and manage Alert messages

---

To allow to receive and manage Alert message it's necessary to set the restriction `AlertMessage` to `true` (false by default)

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Avoid to send message too big
myApp.Restrictions.AlertMessage = true;
```

### Event mode restriction (BOT context)

---

Like described in details in another guide (Cf. [XMPP or Server to Server events mode](/docs/sdk/csharp)) you can select the event mode restriction between XMPP or S2S.

It's recommended to use S2S event mode for BOT context.

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Set S2S as event mode
myApp.Restrictions.EventMode = Restrictions.SDKEventMode.S2S;

// or Set XMPP event mode (default mode)
myApp.Restrictions.EventMode = Restrictions.SDKEventMode.XMPP;
```

### Set the storage mode of messages sent (BOT context)

---

Using `MessageStorageMode` property in `Restrictions` object you can choose how messages sent will stored

-   `Restrictions.SDKMessageStorageMode.Store`: Default mode - When a message is sent, it will be stored by the server. So both, sender and receider will retrieve it as archive even after reconnection.
-   `Restrictions.SDKMessageStorageMode.NoPermanentStore`: The server will store the message, for the receiver ONLY, UNTIL he receives it. This message will not be available as archive. **Recommended in BOT context**
-   `Restrictions.SDKMessageStorageMode.NoStore`: The server will not store the message. If the receiver is not connected when the message is sent, he will never receive the message. **Recommended in BOT context**

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Avoid to store messages sent
myApp.Restrictions.MessageStorageMode = Restrictions.SDKMessageStorageMode.NoPermanentStore;
// or
myApp.Restrictions.MessageStorageMode = Restrictions.SDKMessageStorageMode.NoStore;
```

### Allow to send message to the current connected user of the SDK (BOT context)

---

In a BOT context, perhaps you want to send messages to the current connected user of the SDK. For this use `SendMessageToConnectedUser` property in `Restrictions` object.

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Allow to send message to current connected user of the SDK (by default it's set to false)
myApp.Restrictions.SendMessageToConnectedUser = true;
```

### Automatically send a read receipt (BOT context)

---

In a BOT context, perhaps you want to automatically send a read receipt for each message received. For this use `SendReadReceipt` property in `Restrictions` object.

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Automatically send a read receipt (by default it's set to false)
myApp.Restrictions.SendReadReceipt = true;
```

### Avoid to receive too many information about conversations (BOT context)

---

In a BOT context, it's recommended to avoid to get full information about Conversations for performance reasons.

**LastMessageText**, **LastMessageDate**, **UnreceivedMessageNumber**, **UnreadMessageNumber**, **LastAvatarUpdateDate** information can be avoided when asking conversations list from server.

For this use `ConversationsRetrievedFormat` property in `Restrictions` object.

```csharp
Rainbow.Application myApp = new Rainbow.Application();

// Avoid to receive too many information about conversations (by default it's set to "full")
myApp.Restrictions.ConversationsRetrievedFormat = "small";
```
