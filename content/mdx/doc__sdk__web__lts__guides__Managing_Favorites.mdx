Managing Favorites

LTS release 4.0.0Publiée le 2022-12-21

## Managing Favorites

Rainbow Web SDK allows you to store links to conversations with Users and Bubbles in a handy list called Favorites.

Favorites are essentially a JavaScript array containing objects. Each of those objects the following properties:

-   `type` - describing a type of a Favorite. Can be set either to `user` or `bubble`
-   `id` - representing an ID of a **Favorite**
-   `peerId` - a dbId property of a Bubble or User that is linked to Favorite object
-   `contact` or `room` - essentially a `contact` or `bubble` object that is linked to Favorite item

With those four you will have a good peak on what Users or Bubbles are the most used and essential for the application.

### Retrieving Favorites List

You can retrieve Favorites List from the server by calling `fetchAllFavorites()` method that returns an Array. Favorites Array can be empty when no User or Bubble has been added to Favorites. It is an asynchronous method, therefore it returns a Promise containing the Favorites Array.

```javascript
// somewhere in your code

    rainbowSDK.favorites.fetchAllFavorites()
        .then(function (favorites) {
            // do something with the Favorites Array retrieved from the server
        })
        .catch(function (err) { console.log (err) })
```

### Creating a Favorite

To create a Favorite (add a new object to the Favorites list), use the `favorites.createFavorite()` method which accepts a Bubble or User dbId and type as arguments. `createFavorite()` returns a Promise due to its asynchronous nature.

A snippet below shows how to create a Favorite of each of the types:

```javascript
var user = UserObject;
var bubble = BubbleObject;

// Create a new Favorite from an User:

rainbowSDK.favorites.createFavorite(user.dbId, "user")
    .then( // do something once the Favorite has been created )
    .catch( // do something in case of an error )

    
// Create a new Favorite from a Bubble:

rainbowSDK.favorites.createFavorite(bubble.dbId, "bubble")
    .then( // do something once the Favorite has been created )
    .catch( // do something in case of an error )
```

Once a new Favorite is created, an event is going to be sent. Think of it as a confirmation of the successful Favorite creation process.

```javascript
// somewhere in your code:

        favoriteCreatedEventListener(event) {
            // event.detail contains an object of the freshly-created Favorite
            console.log("Favorite created", event.detail)
        }

        document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.favorites.RAINBOW_ONFAVORITECREATED, favoriteCreatedEventListener)
```

### Deleting a Favorite

Analogically, it is possible to delete a Favorite from the Favorites list by calling the `favorites.deleteFavorite()` method which accepts a Favorite ID string. It is asynchronous and it returns a Promise.

```javascript
var favorite = FavoriteObject; // Favorite Object

    // Delete a Favorite
    rainbowSDK.favorites.deleteFavorite(favorite.id)
        .then(// do something once the Favorite has been deleted)
        .catch(// do something in case of an error)
```

Similarly to creating a Favorite, while deleting one, an event will be dispatched. It is a definite confirmation that a Favorite has been deleted.

```javascript
favoriteDeletedEventListener(event) {
            // event.detail contains an object of the freshly-created Favorite
            console.log("Favorite deleted", event.detail)
        }

        document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.favorites.RAINBOW_ONFAVORITEDELETED, favoriteDeletedEventListener)
```
