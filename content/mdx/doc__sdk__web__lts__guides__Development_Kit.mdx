# Documentation

Development Kit

LTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21

## Development Kit

---

The Rainbow SDK for Web contains:

-   A JavaScript library: This file has to be included in your application.
    
-   Several demo applications to demonstrate how to use the SDK for Web library.
    
-   An API documentation that describes the available APIs (that you can call from your application) and that contains some tutorials explaining the fundamentals parts.
    

### JavaScript SDK library

---

There is no delivery of this file. See the [Getting Started](doc/sdk/web/lts/guides/Getting_Started) guide to understand how to load it.

**Note:** The samples provided here load the SDK for Web library directly from our Rainbow cloud platform. **THIS IS FOR DEMO ONLY AND NOT FOR A COMMON USE**. We **DO NOT** recommend to do this way when developing your application and when releasing it to production. You need to follow the [Getting Started](doc/sdk/web/lts/guides/Getting_Started) guide and download a fixed version that you will need to support as for any other third party libraries you use. This is because sometimes some adaptations need to be done when upgrading to a new version. So, this can't be handled automatically.

### Samples

---

In order to help you discover the Rainbow Web SDK, we have put in place several samples. Each sample can be downloaded. You can then easily look through the source code, adapt-it and finally launch locally.

These samples are connected to the **Sandbox platform** by default so to log-in, you will need some accounts on this platform. Read the guide [Managing tests accounts](/docs/sdk/cli/tutorials/Managing_tests_accounts) to have more information on how to create accounts on the Sandbox platform.

To launch a demo **locally** on your computer:

-   [Clone the GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)
    
-   Open a shell in the directory
    
-   Run the following command: `npm install`
    
-   You will need an SSL certificate. If you do not have one yet, please install [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/)
    
-   Then launch `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem` to generate one locally
    
-   At the end, all you need to do is to run a `npm start` command in the shell. That should start a HTTP server and open your default browser on `http://localhost:8887`
    

Note: There will be security warnings in your browser. It is normal as we will use a certificate not trusted by an external authority.

Respective information considering each of the samples can be found in their respective `README.md` files.
