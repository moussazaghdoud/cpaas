### \[SDK for iOS 2.4.1 LTS\] - June 2022

***API Changes***

-   Since version 2.4.0 LTS, the pushes (IM and VoIP) are automatically encrypted by the server. Therefore, the iOS app needs to decrypt the received IM push by calling method `decryptNotificationContentWithUserInfo` from notificationsManager (the VoIP push is directly decrypted in the SDK):

In the notification service extension :

```
NSString *crypt = [userInfo valueForKeyPath:@"aps.crypt"];
if (crypt != nil) {
    NSDictionary *decryptedUserInfo = [[ServicesManager sharedInstance].notificationsManager decryptNotificationContentWithUserInfo:request.content.userInfo];
} else {
    // Push is not encrypted
}
```

***Other Changes***

-   The documentation to update or delete avatar has been updated
-   The documentation to update user phone numbers has been updated

### \[SDK for iOS 2.4.0 LTS\] - April 2022

***API Changes***

-   You can setup the notification manager to use the sandbox APNs if you are using HTTP/2 based push notifications certificate (APNS v2) : `[[ServicesManager sharedInstance].notificationsManager useSandboxAPNs:YES]`.
-   The property `sharingPublisher` has been added to the object `Conference` to allow displaying the current publisher who is sharing his screen. The notification `kConferencesManagerDidUpdateSharingInConference` is also sent when this value changes.
-   The property `customData` (type of NSDictionary) has been added to the service `MyUser` to access customData of the current connected user. It is accessible by `[ServicesManager sharedInstance].myUser.customData`. It is updatible by `[[ServicesManager sharedInstance].contactsManagerService updateUserWithFields:@{@"customData" : yourCustomDataDictionary} withCompletionBlock:nil];`

***Other Changes***

-   Starting from Rainbow SDK for iOS version 2.4.0 LTS, the IM messages are encrypted using CryptoSwift. We have also started to migrate our API calls to use Alamofire library. Therefor, if not already done, you need to add the dependencies in your application in order to build with this version.

Easy way using Swift Package Manager (but using Carthage is also working):

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.4.3"))
.package(url: "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "5.5.0"))

For these 3 new methods, the completion handler has now the following parameters : - NSArray<File \*> files : list of files fetched - NSUInteger total : total number of files which could be fetched with this method - NSError \*error : the potential error

The enumeration object `FileSortField` has been added with : - FileSortFieldDate - FileSortFieldFilename - FileSortFieldSize

1.  Fetch my files `refreshSharedFileListFromOffset`

This method has been replaced by `fetchMyFilesFromOffset`.

The parameters were : - offset - limit - typeMIME - completionHandler (NSArray of files, offset, total, error)

The parameters are now : - offset - limit - typeMIME - sortOrderField (new) - completionHandler (new)

2.  Fetch files shared with a peer `loadSharedFilesWithPeer`

This method has been replaced by `fetchSharedFilesWithPeer`.

The parameters were : - peer - offset - completionHandler (NSArray of files, error)

The parameters are now : - peer - offset - limit (new) - typeMIME (new) - sortOrderField (new) - completionHandler (new)

3.  Fetch my received files (global)

The new method has been added `fetchMyReceivedFilesFromOffset`

### \[SDK for iOS 1.67.0\] - February 2020

***API/Methods Changes***

##### Mark as read all new received messages

The method to mark as read all new messages received for a conversation in `ConversationsManagerService` has changed.

Internally: - the old method sends an XMPP message for each unread messages to mark as read - the new method sends a REST request to mark all unread messages as read

The name of the method has also changed: - Old name: `-(void) markAsReadByMeAllMessageForConversation:(Conversation *) conversation` - New name: `-(void) markAllMessagesAsReadForConversation:(Conversation *) conversation`

##### Mark as read any new message received

The method to mark as read any new message received for a graphically opened conversation has changed.

The method `-(void) markAsReadByMeAllMessageForConversation:(Conversation *) conversation` has been removed. It was called on UI side any time we receive a new message in the current conversation.

The new way is to set the property `automaticallySendMarkAsReadNewMessage` from a `Conversation` object at : - YES for example in viewWillAppear in the conversation view - NO for example in viewWillDisappear in the conversation view

The SDK will then manage the mark as read behavior.

##### Others changes

    -   Goal: allow the application to display an UI local notification
    -   If you used this notification, replace by:
        -   listening to `kRoomsServiceDidAddRoom` for new room (you probably already listen to it)
        -   using the property `myStatusInRoom` on `Room` object to know if this is a room invitation

```
```
-(void) copyFileIntoRainbowSharing:(File * _Nonnull)file  withCompletionHandler:(FileSharingCompletionHandler _Nullable) completionHandler
```
```

    - The name from `transferFile` to `copyFileIntoRainbowSharing`
    - The `_Nonnull` and `_Nullable` specifiers
```

-   A method to forward a `File` to some `Conversation` has been added tp `FileSharingService`: `-(void) forwardFile:(File * _Nonnull) file to:(NSArray<Conversation *> * _Nonnull) conversations completionHandler:(void(^_Nullable)(NSError * _Nullable error)) completionHandler;`

    -   `-(Message *) sendReplyMessage:(NSString *)text forMessage:(Message *)previousMessage withMention:(NSArray<NSString *> * _Nullable)mentionedPeerJIDs to:(Conversation *) conversation completionHandler:(ConversationsManagerServiceSendMessageCompletionHandler) completionHandler`
    -   `-(Message *) sendReplacementMessageForMessage:(Message *)message replacementText:(NSString *)text withMention:(NSArray<NSString *> * _Nullable)mentionedPeerJIDs to:(Conversation *) conversation completionHandler:(ConversationsManagerServiceSendMessageCompletionHandler) completionHandler;`
    -   `-(void) forwardMessage:(Message * _Nonnull) message to:(NSArray<Conversation *> * _Nonnull) conversations completionHandler:(void(^_Nullable)(NSError * _Nullable error)) completionHandler`
