Development Kit

LTS release 2.6.XPubliée le 2021-12-13

## Development Kit

The Rainbow CSharp SDK Development Kit contains:

-   An CSharp Assembly library: This assembly has to be included using Nuget platform.
    
-   Several starter kit applications to demonstrate how to use it.
    
    -   Small samples (as `Desktop applications`) to understand how to use the SDK (available on on `Windows`, `MacOS`)
    -   Advanced sample (as `Mobile application`) going deeper in SDK available for `IOS` and `MacOs`
    -   S2S (Server to Server) (as 'BOT application') to understand how to use S2S event mode

### CSharp assembly library

---

The Rainbow CSharp SDK is available via Nuget. See the [Getting started](/docs/sdk/csharp) guide to understand how to load it.

### Starter kits - Small samples

---

To understand how the the SDK for CSharp must be used, some projects or starter kit are available on Github. (for Windows and MacOS)

You can have access to these samples by cloning the GitHub project: [Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples)

Examples are listed in order of priority if you just start to use the SDK.

### Starter kits - Advanced Mobile Application Sample

### Starter kits - S2S as BOT sample application

---

It's important to read this [guide](/docs/sdk/csharp) first to understand what is a S2S application and the architecture associated.

This [sample](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/S2S) permits to understand how to use this SDK in Server to server contetx. It's better first to understand how to use the SDK using small examples.

This [sample](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/S2S) is based on the small sample `Instant Messaging` but using S2S event mode.
