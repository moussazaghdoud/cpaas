Prerequisites

## Prerequisites

---

The following paragraphes list the prerequisites to developing with Rainbow.

### If you're developing Web application

---

When developing Web applications, you will use mainly the **SDK for Web**. Here is the list of requirements you need.

Requirements

SDK for Web

**OS**

Windows, MacOS, Linux \[1\]

**Target**

Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge \[2\]

**Server**

Any web server \[3\]

**Knowledge**

Front-end Web development

**Size**

~3.5MB

**Availability**

YES

**Dependencies**

JQuery 2.3.1, AngularJS 1.7.5 \[4\], Moment 2.x

\[1\]: VDI environments are not supported. SDK for Web may be used on mobile platforms but induce a higher battery consumption than using our mobile SDKs.

\[2\]: Audio and Video services based on WebRTC are accessible on Chrome, Edge and Firefox only.

\[3\]: Like Apache, NodeJS, Nginx. Node.JS is mandatory for installing the Rainbow SDK for Web.

\[4\]: Starting from version 1.54, Rainbow Web SDK will work only with AngularJS 1.7.5. Old versions of the Rainbow Web SDK still work with AngularJS 1.5.7.

### If you're developing Server side applications

---

If you're developing Server side applications, you could use either the **SDK for Node.JS**, the **SDK CSharp** or directly our **REST APIs** for administrative tasks.

Requirements

SDK for Node.JS

SDK for CSharp

REST API

**OS**

Windows, MacOS, Linux \[1\]

Windows, MacOS, Linux

Any OS

**Target**

Node.JS application

Web application

Any application

**Environment**

Node.JS

.Net environment

Any languages

**Knowledge**

Back-end Web development

Back-end Web development

REST development

**Event Pipe**

XMPP

XMPP or S2S

\-

**Size**

~1MB

~2.5MB

\-

**Availability**

YES

YES

YES

**Dependencies**

Node.JS active LTS version \[2\]

\[1\]: VDI environments are not supported.

\[2\]: SDK Node.JS is supported only from the active NodeJS and NPM LTS version.

### If you're developing Mobile applications

---

If you're developing mobile applications, you could use the **SDK for Android** , the **SDK for iOS**, the **SDK CSharp** or the **SDK ReactNative**.

Requirements

SDK for Android

SDK for iOS

SDK CSharp

SDK ReactNative

**OS**

Android  
Starting Marshmallow

iOS  
Starting iOS 13

iOS Starting iOS 9  
Android Starting Lollipop

iOS>=9, Android >= 6 (Marshmallow)

**Target**

An Android device

An iOS device

An iOS device or and Adnroid device

An iOS or Android device

**Environment**

Android device or AVD

iOS device or virtual device

iOS device, Android or virtual device

iOS, Android or virtual device, VSCode or equivalent

**Knowledge**

Android development  
Android Studio development

Objectice C or Swift \[1\]  
XCode development

CSharp (Xamarin on iOS and on Androidd).  
Can reuse existing Objective C or Java code

JavaScript, ReactNative

**Size**

~15MB

~15MB

~5MB

\[1\]: Swift applications can import and use our SDK for iOS based on Objective C.

#### Developing Mobile Web applications

In case of multi-platforms applications based on Web technologies (JavaScript), you can use our SDK for Web but with the following limitations:

Theme

ANDROID

iOS

**MEDIA**

**More battery consumption**  
WebRTC Audio and Video call can induce a higher battery usage.

**No Audio/Video Call**  
Browsers on iOS are based on WebKit which is not yet supported by our SDK Web.

**PUSH**

**More battery/data consumtion**  
Websocket connection will be maintained (to receive notifications) when in background which can induce a higher battery and data usage.

**No Push notifications**  
Web applications in background can't received incoming notifications

**Note:** At this time of writing, support of Webkit based browsers is in progress.

**Note:** Building hybrid applications (eg. Cordova, Ionic...) will allow you to receive push notifications on all platforms.

#### Developing Mobile Hybrid applications

At this time of writing, we have not experienced enough Mobile Hybrid based applications with the **SDK Web** for supporting this kind of applications officially. We are relaying on your experiments to help us moving in that direction.

### If you're developing Desktop applications

---

If you're developing desktop applications, you could use the the **SDK CSharp**

Requirements

SDK CSharp (Beta version)

**OS**

Windows, MacOS

**Knowledge**

CSharp development

**Size**

~5MB
