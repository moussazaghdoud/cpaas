SDK and server errors

LTS release 2.6.XPublished on 2021-12-13

## Errors list

Most of SDK methods use **SdkResult<T>** object to provide a result or the reason of the error

If no error occurs **SdkResult<T>.Result.Succcess** is equals to **True**. In this case **SdkResult<T>.Data** contains an object on **T** type.

If an error occurs **SdkResult<T>.Result.Succcess** is equals to **False**. To get information about the error the **SdkResult<T>.Result** (which is a **SdkError** object) cand be used.

There is three type of **SdkError** - see **SdkErrorType**:

-   **SdkErrorType.NoError**: There is no error. You have to use **SdkResult<T>.Data**
-   **SdkErrorType.Exception**: An unexpected exception has occurred. To have more information readable information use **SdkError.ToString()** or use **SdkError.Exception** object
-   **SdkErrorType.IncorrectUse**: The way to use the method is not done correctly (network error, server errors, or sdk errors - like invalid parameter). In this case properties you can use **ErrorCode**, **ErrorDetailsCode**, **ErrorDetails** and **ErrorDetailsData** of the object **SdkError.IncorrectUseError** for more information.

if **SdkErrorType.IncorrectUse.ErrorCode** is equals to **1000**, it means that the SDK itself has raised an error.

For other values, it means that the Rainbowserver has raised an error.

Find below a full list of potential errors returned by the SDK or by the server.
