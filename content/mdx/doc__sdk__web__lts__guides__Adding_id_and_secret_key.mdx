Adding application ID and secret key

LTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21

## Adding Application ID and Secret key

---

To connect to Rainbow, the Web SDK needs to be authenticated.

This is done by injecting an Application ID and a Secret Key. This guide will help you understand how to connect to Rainbow.

### Preamble

---

For more information on the application lifecycle, you can read the tutorial [Application lifecycle](/docs/hub/application-lifecycle).

When you want to develop your Rainbow application and use it with real users, it needs to be authenticated by Rainbow and needs an application ID and secret key.

If you don't provide an application ID and secret key, your application will not be able to connect to Rainbow and all requests will be refused by Rainbow.

### Create an application

---

The first thing to do is to create an application on the Rainbow for Developers.

-   Open your browser and navigate to the [Rainbow for developers](/)
    
-   Sign in using your Rainbow account
    
-   In the Applications panel, click on the button "Create new application"
    
-   Fill the application information and click on the button "Save"
    

Your application is now created. You can use it on the Rainbow Developers Sandboxed Platform.

### Get your application ID and secret key

---

Once your application is created, you can retrieve the application ID and secret key by clicking on the button "View Key".

Keep this information for yourself and do not share it with anyone.

### Inject your application ID and secret key

```html
<html lang="en">

    ...
    <body>
        <script>
            import rainbowSDK from 'rainbow-web-sdk';

            /* Callback for handling the event 'RAINBOW_ONREADY' */
            var onReady = function onReady() {
                // Do something with the SDK is ready (e.g. user signed in)
                ...
            };

            var onLoaded = function onLoaded() {

                rainbowSDK.initialize("your_application_ID", "your_secret_key").then(function() {
                    // Do something when the SDK is initialized
                    ...
                }).catch(function() {
                    // Do something if there is an issue in the initialization of the SDK
                    ...
                });
            };

            /* Listen to the SDK event RAINBOW_ONREADY */
            document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.RAINBOW_ONREADY, onReady)

            /* Listen to the SDK event RAINBOW_ONLOADED */
            document.addEventListener(rainbowSDK.RAINBOW_ONLOADED, onLoaded)

            /* Manually load the SDK */
            rainbowSDK.load();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
