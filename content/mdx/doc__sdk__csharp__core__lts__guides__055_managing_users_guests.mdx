## Managing Users and Guests

This guide explains:

-   How to manage Organisations and Companies
-   How to manage User, Guest and GuestMode

-   How to manage Bubble Link

It's based on a full example available [here](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/Rainbow-CSharp-SDK-Samples/tree/master/SDK%20V3.X/ConsoleApp/Manage%20Users%20and%20Guests/README.md)

You need an admin account to manage nearly all this features except Bubble Link creation and GuestMode

### Organisation

According its rights, an admin account can manage one or several organisations.

In an organisation, you can have several companies.

You have to use the [Administration](/docs/sdk/csharp) service.

You have these methods:

-   CreateOrganisationAsync(), DeleteOrganisationAsync() and UpdateOrganisationAsync()
-   GetOrganisationsAsync() and GetOrganisationAsync()
-   AddCompanyToOrganisationAsync() and RemoveCompanyFromOrganisationAsync()

If you don't have the right to manage organisation, an error will be raised by the server.

### Company

In an organisation, you can have several companies.

You have to use the [Administration](/docs/sdk/csharp) service.

### Create User and GuestMode

According its rights, an admin account can create users and guests.

You have to use the [Administration](/docs/sdk/csharp) service.

It's possible to create them in several ways:

-   CreateUserAsync() - a standard user is created
-   CreateUserWithCompanyLinkAsync() - a standard user is created using a Company Link (see dedicated chapter). **It's not necessary to have admin rights to use this method**
-   CreateUserWithBubbleLinkAsync() - a **GuestMode** is created using a Bubble Link (see dedicated chapter). **It's not necessary to have admin rights to use this method**

### Differences between standard User and GuestMode

To know if a Contact is a GuestMode, check **GuestMode** property of a [Contact](/docs/sdk/csharp)

A GuestMode can be created **without admin rights** using **Administration.CreateUserWithBubbleLinkAsync()**

GuestMode restrictions:

-   it has been created thanks to a Bubble Link - so it's related to a bubble
-   it will be disabled / removed:
    -   when the conference of this bubble is finished and if it has joined it
    -   or after 48 hours
-   it can't have a network / roster: No user can be added to the guest's network (subject to change).
-   it can’t be added to a user's network.
-   it can’t do search (subject to change).
-   it can’t create a bubble, a channel or a group (can be added into bubbles, channels or groups).
-   it can't be associated to Hybrid or Hub devices
-   it CAN post a file (can receive files).
-   **it CAN participate to the conference related to this bubble**
-   **it CAN be found by search**

### Company Link

According its rights, an admin account can create Company Link.

-   CreateJoinCompanyLinkAsync(), DeleteJoinCompanyLinkAsync()

-   GetDomainNameFromBubbleLink()

Once you have a valid Company Link, you can create users **without admin rights** using **Administration.CreateUserWithCompanyLinkAsync()**.

### Bubble Link

Any user who is Owner or Moderator of a Bubble can manage Bubble Link.

You have to use the [Bubbles](/docs/sdk/csharp) service.

You have these methods:

-   CreateBubbleLinkAsync(), RemoveBubbleLinkAsync(), GenerateNewBubbleLinkAsync()
-   GetBubbleLinkAsync()
-   CheckBubbleLinkValidityAsync()
-   JoinByBubbleLinkAsync() - to join a bubble if you have it's Bubble Link
