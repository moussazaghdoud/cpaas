Bubble Service

### Bubble Services

---

### Preamble

---

The bubble services module `bubblesService` have all the methods that supported by this library.

### Listen to bubbles list updates

---

You can listen when there is any bubble list updated by using `eventEmitter.addListener` with the event name `EventType.BubblesListUpdated` and it will get to you the updated bubble list as array of bubbles objects (`IBubble[]`):

```ts
...
eventEmitter.addListener(
      EventType.BubblesListUpdated,
      (eventData: IBubble[]) => {
        // handle the new updated bubble list
      }
    );
...
```

### Listen to one bubble updates

---

You can listen when there is any changes to a bubble updated by using `eventEmitter.addListener` with the event name `EventType.OnBubbleUpdated` and it will get to you the updated bubble Object as its shown in the following:

```ts
...
eventEmitter.addListener(
      EventType.OnBubbleUpdated,
      (updatedObject: IBubble) => {
        // handle the new updated bubble object
      }
    );
...
```

### Get All Bubbles

---

To get all the bubbles object that the connected user is a had joined it or created you can call `bubblesService.getBubbles` and this method will trigger the `EventType.BubblesListUpdated` event

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const getAllBubbles = () => {
bubblesService.getBubbles();
}
// listen the Bubbles list from the event
eventEmitter.addListener(
      EventType.BubblesListUpdated,
      (eventData: IBubble[]) => {
        // handle the new updated bubble list
      }
    );
```

### Get the Invited Bubbles

---

To get all the pending invited bubbles, you can call `bubblesService.getInvitedBubbles`, you can get the invited bubble by calling `EventType.GetInvitedBubbles` through `eventEmitter.addListener`

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const getPendingInvitedBubbles = () => {
bubblesService.getInvitedBubbles();
}
// listen the Pending Invited Bubbles result
 eventEmitter.addListener(
            EventType.GetInvitedBubbles,
            (bubble: IBubble[]) => {
                // handle the pending invited bubble
            }
        );
```

### Accept/Decline the Invited Bubbles

---

To accept the pending invited bubbles, you can call `bubblesService.acceptBubbleInvitation(bubbleId: string)`, and to decline the bubble invitation you can use `bubblesService.declineBubbleInvitation(bubbleId: string)`, where the `bubbleId` is the bubble jid. You can listen to bubble invitation result when ever its accepted or declined by using listening to `EventType.InvitedBubblesResult`

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const acceptInvitation = (bubbleId: string) => {
bubblesService.acceptBubbleInvitation(bubbleId);
}

const declineInvitation = (bubbleId: string) => {
bubblesService.declineBubbleInvitation(bubbleId);
}

// Listen to invitation result
eventEmitter.addListener(
            EventType.InvitedBubblesResult,
            (result: string) => {
              // the result is either equal to "success" or "failure"
            }
        );
```

### Create Bubble

---

To create bubble, you can call `bubblesService.createBubble(name: string, topic: string)`, where the `name` is the bubble title and the `topic` is the bubble description. You can get to the bubble creation result by listening to `EventType.CreateBubbleResult` event.

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const createBubble = (name: string, topic: string) => {
bubblesService.createBubble(name, topic);
}
// Listen to bubble creation result
eventEmitter.addListener(
      EventType.CreateBubbleResult,
      (creationResult: BubbleErrorCode) => {
        // handle creation result
      }
    );
```

You can check for more detail about `BubbleErrorCode` type through this [IBubble](/docs/sdk/reactnative/api/IBubble).

### Create Bubble With Participant

---

To initiate bubble with participant, you can call `bubblesService.createBubbleWithParticipants(name: string, topic: string, participantsId: string[])`, where the `name` is the bubble title and the `topic` is the bubble description and `participantsId` is an array of the contacts jid. You can get to the bubble creation result by listening to `EventType.CreateBubbleResult` event.

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const initiateBubbleWithParticipants = (name: string, topic: string, participantsId: string[]) => {
bubblesService.createBubbleWithParticipants(name, topic,participantsId);
}
// Listen to bubble creation result
eventEmitter.addListener(
      EventType.CreateBubbleResult,
      (creationResult: BubbleErrorCode) => {
        // handle creation result
      }
    );
```

You can check for more detail about `BubbleErrorCode` type through this [IBubble](/docs/sdk/reactnative/api/IBubble).

### Create Auto Accepted Bubble

---

To create auto accepted bubble where `auto accept` mean that all invitations to add a new participant in this room will be auto accepted. The user won't receive any notification to accept or decline. By calling `bubblesService.createAutoAcceptedBubble(name: string, topic: string)`, where the and`name` is the bubble title and the `topic` is the bubble description. You can get to the bubble creation result by listening to `EventType.CreateBubbleResult` event.

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const createAutoAcceptedBubble = (name: string, topic: string) => {
bubblesService.createAutoAcceptedBubble(name, topic);
}
// Listen to bubble creation result
eventEmitter.addListener(
      EventType.CreateBubbleResult,
      (creationResult: BubbleErrorCode) => {
        // handle creation result
      }
    );
```

You can check for more detail about `BubbleErrorCode` type through this [IBubble](/docs/sdk/reactnative/api/IBubble).

### Leave Bubble

---

To leave the bubble you can use `bubblesService.leaveBubble(bubbleId: string)`, where the `bubbleId` is the bubble jid for the bubble you wanna leave. You can get to the bubble leaving result by listening to `EventType.LeaveBubbleResult` event.

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const leaveFromBubble = (bubbleId: string) => {
bubblesService.leaveBubble(bubbleId);
}
// Listen to bubble leaving result
eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.LeaveBubbleResult,
(result: string) => {
     // the result is either equal to "success" or "failure"
    }
  );
```

### Archive Bubble

---

To archive the bubble you can use `bubblesService.archiveBubble(bubbleId: string)`, where the `bubbleId` is the bubble jid for the bubble you wanna archive. For the archiving action, you have the following two cases:

1.  If you are the owner, all participants are archived.
2.  If you are NOT the owner, you just leave the bubble.

You can get to the bubble archiving result by listening to `EventType.ArchiveBubbleResult` event.

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const archivingBubble = (bubbleId: string) => {
bubblesService.archiveBubble(bubbleId);
}
// Listen to bubble archiving result
eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.ArchiveBubbleResult,
(result: string) => {
      // the result is either equal to "success" or "failure"
    }
  );
```

### Delete Bubble

---

To delete the bubble you can use `bubblesService.deleteBubble(bubbleId: string)`, where the `bubbleId` is the bubble jid for the bubble you wanna delete. You can get to the bubble deleting result by listening to `EventType.DeleteBubbleResult` event.

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const deleteTheBubble = (bubbleId: string) => {
bubblesService.deleteBubble(bubbleId);
}
// Listen to bubble deleting result
eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.DeleteBubbleResult,
(result: string) => {
      // the result is either equal to "success" or "failure"
    }
  );
```

### Get Bubble By Id

---

To get the bubble by its id you can use `bubblesService.getBubbleById(bubbleId: string)`, where the `bubbleId` is the bubble jid for the bubble you wanna get. You can get to the requested bubble result by listening to `EventType.GetBubbleByIdResult` event.

```ts
import {bubblesService } from 'react-native-rainbow-module'
...
const getBubbleByItsId = (bubbleId: string) => {
bubblesService.getBubbleById(bubbleId);
}
// Listen to bubble deleting result
eventEmitter.addListener(EventType.GetBubbleByIdResult,
(result? : IBubble) => {
      // the result is optional, which mean if the bubble is not found the result will be null
      if(result){
        // handle the
      }
      else {
        // The requested bubble NOT found
