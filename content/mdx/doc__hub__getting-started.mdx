Getting started

## Getting started

---

Welcome to our *built with passion* Rainbow for Developers !

Here is the place where you can find all the documentation and materials regarding the different ways to integrate with ALE Rainbow using our Rainbow SDKs and APIs. From a client side integration through a web page or a mobile application to a server side integration, the Rainbow for Developers offers different solutions depending on your needs.

Take time to read this documentation and have fun playing with Rainbow !

### How to read this documentation

---

We grouped together all the documentation around Rainbow SDKs and APIs in that place. You're reading this first guide which is in fact a sum-up of what you can expect from our Rainbow CPaaS platform.

From the left menu, you can find a lot of guides, each focusing on a key concept or a group of API. We organized this menu like that:

-   In the **Basics** section, you will find all the guides to start from the beginning such as the [Prerequisites](/docs/hub/prerequisites), the [developer's journey road book](/docs/hub/developer-journey) that will give you step by step the actions to do for using our Rainbow services. If you don't understand some Rainbow 'words', have a look to our [glossary](/docs/hub/glossary).
    
-   The **Advanced guides** section will give you the keys to go deeper with Rainbow and use the platform at 150%. All concepts such as the [privacy rules](/docs/hub/users-visibility-and-privacy) or the way [core concepts](/docs/hub/rainbow-core-concepts) works and how to [deploy on production](/docs/hub/get-ready-for-production).
    
-   Then, each SDK has 2 separates sections: One giving a complete **API documentation** and the other offering several **guides** to explain in details how to use our SDK and API to do things such as sending a chat message to a user, calling someone in video, etc... Don't miss the **what's new** guide that sums-up the list of changes in each new release of SDK and APIs.
    
-   Our C#, Web, NodeJS, Android and iOS SDKs follow the LTS / STS release policy. Both LTS (Long Term Support) and STS (Short Term Support) documentations are available. LTS documentation will show you all the features contained in the current LTS version. STS documentation will show you latest features that are not yet available in LTS version. By default, the documentation displayed for these SDKs is the LTS version documentation. If you need to read the STS version documentation, you can switch the documentation version from your profile page once logged in. Please read [LTS SDK support policy and versions](/docs/hub/lts-support-sdk-version) for all details about this new support policy.
    

### Our CPaaS platform

---

Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise Rainbow for Developers is an **open platform as a service (CPaaS)** with a set of APIs allowing you to integrate Rainbow's powerful collaboration tools into your existing in-house applications and business processes. Rainbow brings rich feature capabilities, like contact management, presence, chat, audio/video call, screen and file sharing. In addition to these features, Rainbow takes a hybrid cloud approach, integrating with Alcatel-Lucent OXO Connect and OmniPCX Enterprise, as well as non-ALE PBXs and so providing APIs to control your phone device. Rainbow Hub cloud PBX are also supported.

#### Built to digitalize your business

The Rainbow for Developers makes it easy your **digital transformation** by providing you APIs, documentation and support that let you build applications that connect people and transform the way they work. For example, a school district can take advantage of a broadcast lockdown and response application in a crisis, a hotel can leverage the Rainbow services integrated into their customer loyalty program application, or a bank can use Rainbow to integrate messaging and notifications over their customer relationship applications.

#### Tailored to your needs

The Rainbow for Developers offers several SDKs, APIs, libraries and tools that are available on a lot of platforms and systems to match with your ecosystem.

#### Dedicated environment for developing

As a developer, you can use our free **Rainbow developers sandbox platform** that is a dedicated instance of Rainbow for developers.

You will be able to develop and test without any fees and without disturbing Rainbow users your application by using all the essential services of Rainbow (Chat, Audio/video, file sharing, etc...).

Once ready, you will be able to connect your application to our **Rainbow production platform** to benefit of our Rainbow global intrastructure tailored for being accessible worldwide with the same quality of service.

#### Secured environments that protect your data

Rainbow meets by design the requirements of the GDPR (European union general data protection regulation): Protecting your personal data is important to ALE. Refer to [Data privacy notice](https://www.openrainbow.com/dataprivacy) for details about our data privacy.

In CPaaS context, ALE is the provider of the Rainbow API or the Rainbow API licensor and is therefore Data Processor (as defined in the GDPR) whereas the Rainbow API licensee (the Developer) is either i) a Data Controller if it has a direct relationship with the end users or ii) also a Data Processor when it sells via an indirect model. As such, in both positions, depending on the jurisdiction of where it is operating its application and where it is selling its application, the Developer may have to be compliant with local regulation pertaining to data protection. This could materialized by (without limitation) collecting and duly recording consent from Data Subjects prior to data processing, disclosing to its parties explicit and understandable information on which personal data is collected, used in which processing, for which purposes, stored for which limit of duration, and list the rights that the Data Subjects have and how they can request them to be carried out.

### Addendum

---

#### Our CPaaS story

Our CPaaS platform has grown with care since the beginning of Rainbow. In 2016 and using the **Rainbow SDK for Web**, we saw our first developers integrate video services in their web applications. They were so proud to have these features!

In early 2017, we released our first version of the **Rainbow SDK for NodeJS** and immediately our community of developpers started creating bots interacting with Rainbow users for offering additionnal services. In the same time, we developed a **Rainbow CLI tool** and we made public **lot of REST APIs** to save you time on Rainbow administrative tasks. In September, we released the **Rainbow SDK for Android** our first step on mobility platform. And finally in the last quarter of 2017, we released our CPaaS platform **Rainbow for Developers** to allow our community of developers to meet together in one place for sharing their passion on Rainbow and finding materials for helping them.

The beginning of the year 2018 was focused on delivering lot of **starter-kits, guides and samples** to help our growing community. In the same time we released our new **Rainbow SDK for iOS** to complete our mobile ecosystem.

Then came a multi-platform **Rainbow SDK for C#** and the new **Rainbow SDK for ReactNative**.

And here we are, at the edge of a new journey with this new version of our Rainbow for Developers that let you create your applications and access to your metrics.

But as mentionned, this journey has just started. We are working on a plenty of new things that we can't wait to show you. To continue...

#### When using an SDK?

Our SDKs offer high level APIs that abstract you from the complexity of the Rainbow Platform. By using our SDK, you focus on your application and not on understanding how Rainbow low layers work. For example, in some lines of code, you can make an audio & video communication without having to understand how technologies like WebRTC works.

Using an SDK is **mandatory** when using the "real time" facilities and services of Rainbow. Our SDKs will manage all the real time interactions and events that are exchanged with Rainbow while monitoring your connection and automatically reconnect or alert you in case of trouble like when the network is lost.

Additionaly to that, using an SDK will prevent your application from incompatibilities against the Rainbow platform. Your application will stay compliant with Rainbow and can interact with our existing official applications.

#### When preferring REST APIs?

Rainbow SDKs are the way to go to access all the features of Rainbow including real-time communication. If you have only Rainbow management or administration needs, you can use Rainbow REST APIs.

In these cases, our REST API are so easy to use that you can call them from your existing application (server side or client side) without the need to embed a SDK and so from any technologies.

OpenAPI definition files are available for each API portal allowing easy generation of client stub code.

We are working to make public more and more REST APIs in the coming months to let you build applications in your specific application language.
