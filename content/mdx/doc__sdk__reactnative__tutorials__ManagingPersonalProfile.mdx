Manage personal profile

### Managing Personal Profile

---

### Preamble

---

Using the Rainbow SDK for react native, you can manage your personal information by getting or updating them.

### Get The Connected User Info

You can get the connected user profile information by calling the component `<UserProfile />` from `react-native-rainbow-module`. This component will return the connected user :

-   name
-   company name
-   presence
-   profile picture

### Change Your Presence

You can change your Rainbow presence to `Online`, `Away`, `Offline` or `Do not disturb` by calling `<PresenceList />` from the sdk library. This component will allow you to change your presence and listen of any presence changes. In Addition it allow you to customize the style of the presence icon by pass the optional props `presenceIconStyle` check code below.

You can use the `<UserProfile />` and `<PresenceList/>` as shown in example code below:

```tsx
import { Content, List, View } from 'native-base';
import React from 'react';
import { UserProfile, PresenceList } from 'react-native-rainbow-module';

const presenceIconStyle: ImageStyle = {
    width: 25,
    height: 25,
};
class AppMenuView extends React.Component<IProps> {
    constructor(props: IProps) {
        super(props);
    }

    public render() {
        return (
            <SafeAreaView style={defaultStyle.safeArea}>
                <UserProfile />
                    <View style={defaultStyle.menuContentContainer}>
                        <Content>
                            <List>
                                <PresenceList presenceIconStyle={presenceIconStyle} />
                            </List>
                        </Content>
                    </View>
            </SafeAreaView>

        );
    }
   }
export default AppMenuView;
};
```
