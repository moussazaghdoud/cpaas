# Documentation

Integrating Angular 1.x applications

LTS release 4.0.0Published on 2022-12-21

## Integrating AngularJS 1.x applications

---

The SDK for Web is an AngularJS 1.x based library. Internally, JavaScript modules of the SDK are based on AngularJS Services, Models, etc...

If your application is based on AngularJS 1.x too, this tutorial will describe how to integrate and use Rainbow Web SDK.

If it's not the case either because your application is based on an other JavaScript framework or a more recent version of AngularJS, you have to read the guide [Integrating JS frameworks](doc/sdk/web/lts/guides/Integrating_JS_frameworks).

### Preamble

---

To be able to use our Rainbow SDK for Web in an AngularJS 1.x application you will need to follow the steps below:

-   Install Rainbow Web SDK NPM package
    
-   Load the SDK
    
-   Start the SDK
    
-   Initialize the SDK
    
-   Subscribe to events
    
-   Call methods
    

### Rainbow Knowledge

---

Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide.

Rainbow concept

Details

**SDK loader**

The SDK Loader is an open-source library made by Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise. It helps loading the SDK for Web and all its dependencies in an AngularJS 1.x application.

**Events**

Events are asynchronous messages or notifications that come from Rainbow when something related to your data happens.  
By listening to theses events, your application will be able to react and inform the user of these changes.

**Methods**

Methods are all the SDK functions your application can call to enable Rainbow services such as initiating a WebRTC call, sending a file, etc. In most of the cases, Methods are asynchronous and follow the JavaScript Promise pattern.

### Rainbow SDK for Web installation

---

Open a shell console and execute the following command in your application directory (application root folder):

```shell
$ npm install rainbow-web-sdk --save
```

Then copy the files to a directory served by your Web server (e.g. `public/`).

```shell
$cp ./node_modules/rainbow-web-sdk/dist/vendors-sdk.min.js <your_folder>
$cp ./node_modules/rainbow-web-sdk/dist/rainbow-sdk.min.js <your_folder>
$cp ./node_modules/rainbow-web-sdk/dist/loader-sdk.min.js <your_folder>
```

### Loading Rainbow SDK for Web

---

In your **AngularJS** application, you can load SDK for Web by using our own loader. For more details, have a look to the guide [Loading AngularJS applications](doc/sdk/web/lts/guides/Loading_Angular_1x_applications)

In your entry HTML file (e.g. index.html), add the following script at the end of your `<body>` tag. This will get the SDK for Web loader from the Rainbow official cloud and load your configuration file.

```html
<!-- Add the following lines to your 'index.html' file -->
<html lang="en" ng-controller="sampleController">
  <body>
    ...
    <script src="<path_to_your_file>/loader-sdk.min.js" data-main="./config.json"></script>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

When the browser executes your HTML file, it will load your `config.json` file that has to be correctly filled.

Once done, the SDK for Web, its dependencies and your application files that use the SDK will be loaded by the browser.

### Starting the SDK

---

Using the **loader**, the SDK for Web is started automatically once the files have been loaded by the browser.

From your application files (e.g. from your main controller), you can listen when this loading step is complete by adding these lines:

```javascript
/* In your controller file, add the following lines to depend on the SDK module */
var sample = angular.module("sample", ["sdk"]);

sample.controller("sampleController", [
    "rainbowSDK",
    function(sdk) {
        "use strict";

        var onLoaded = function onLoaded() {
            // The SDK has been loaded successfully
            console.log("[DEMO] :: Rainbow SDK has been loaded!");
        };

        // Listen when the SDK has been loaded successfully
        $rootScope.$on(sdk.RAINBOW_ONLOADED, onLoaded);
    }
]);
```

### Initializing the SDK

---

Before you can call SDK methods, you need to initialize the SDK, by calling the method `initialize()` and listen to the `RAINBOW_ONREADY` event in order to be sure that the SDK has been started correctly.

Simply add the following lines to your application:

```javascript
/* In your controller file, add the following lines to depend on the sdk module */
var sample = angular.module("sample", ["sdk"]);

sample.controller("sampleController", [
    "rainbowSDK",
    function(sdk) {
        "use strict";

        var onReady = function onReady() {
            console.log("[DEMO] :: Rainbow SDK is ready!");
        };

        var onLoaded = function onLoaded() {
            console.log("[DEMO] :: Rainbow SDK has been loaded!");

            sdk.initialize()
                .then(function() {
                    console.log("[DEMO] :: Rainbow SDK is initialized!");
                })
                .catch(function() {
                    console.log("[DEMO] :: Something went wrong with the SDK...");
                });
        };

        $rootScope.$on(sdk.RAINBOW_ONREADY, onReady);

        $rootScope.$on(sdk.RAINBOW_ONLOADED, onLoaded);
    }
]);
```

### Calling the SDK methods

---

Once your application has been loaded and initialized successfully, you can call Rainbow SDK methods by using the keyword `sdk` followed by a service name such as `contacts` or `bubbles` and a method like `getContactById()`.

For example, you can initiate a webRTC call by using the method `sdk.webRTC.callInVideo(Contact)`.

Most of the time, methods are asynchronous and return a JavaScript Promise.

### Subscribing to SDK Events

---

As seen in the previous code sample, to subscribe to Rainbow events, you need to use the AngularJS method `$rootScope.$on()` with a Rainbow event name such as `sdk.RAINBOW_ONLOADED`. A JavaScript callback method will be called once the event is fired.

Read Rainbow Web SDK API documentation for the complete list of events. Each Rainbow SDK for Web guide describes the required events to subscribe when doing a specific action (e.g. calling a contact, sending a file, etc.).
