Managing call logs

LTS release 2.12.0Published on 2024-07-23

## Managing call logs

---

Rainbow manages up to 75 call logs.

By reading this tutorial, you will be able

-   To retrieve your call logs
    
-   To mark call logs as read
    
-   To delete call logs
    

### Coding using Swift

---

This tutorial uses the **Swift** language. Objective-C code will not be provided, if needed please ask for having it in our [Rainbow for developers Forum](https://support.openrainbow.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/115000150070-Hub-Support-Community)

### Retrieving your call logs

---

When connecting to the Rainbow server, the SDK retrieves the call logs for the current connected user. Once retrieved, the `kCallLogsServiceDidFetchCallLogs` event is fired. Afterwards, if a new call log l is received by the SDK, the event `kCallLogsServiceDidAddCallLog` is fired to allow the update of the list in your application. Events are also fired when call logs are removed (`kCallLogsServiceDidRemoveAllCallLogs` and `kCallLogsServiceDidRemoveCallLogs`).

Retrieve the call logs.

```swift
// somewhere in your code
var callLogs: Array<CallLog>

callLogs = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().callLogsService.getAllCallLogs()


// you're only interested by the unread call logs

let unreadCallLogs = ServicesManager.sharedInstance().callLogsService.getUnreadCallLogs()
```

### Mark call logs as read

---

#### Mark all call logs as read

---

```swift
ServicesManager.sharedInstance().callLogsService.markAllCallLogsAsRead()
```

#### Mark call logs as read for a given contact

---

```swift
let contact = ...

ServicesManager.sharedInstance().callLogsService.markCallLogsAsRead(withRemoteParty: contact)
```

### Delete call logs

---

#### Delete all call logs

---

```swift
ServicesManager.sharedInstance().callLogsService.deleteAllCallLogs()
```

#### Delete call logs for a given contact

---

```swift
let contact = ...

ServicesManager.sharedInstance().callLogsService.deleteCallLog(withRemoteParty: contact)
```

#### Delete a given call log

---

```swift
let callLog = ...

ServicesManager.sharedInstance().callLogsService.delete(callLog)
```

#### Listening to call logs changes

---

Each time the SDK manages any changes in the call logs list, a relevant event is fired:

-   `kCallLogsServiceDidRemoveAllCallLogs` :
-   `didRemoveCallLogs` :
-   `kCallLogsServiceDidAddCallLog` :

```swift
// Somewhere in your application
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(didAddCallLog), name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: kCallLogsServiceDidAddCallLog), object: nil)

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(didRemoveCallLogs), name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: kCallLogsServiceDidRemoveCallLogs), object: nil)

// handler

@objc
func didAddCallLog(notification: Notification) {
    if let callLog = notification.object as? CallLog {
        // Add the callLog to your call logs array ...
    }
}

@objc
func didRemoveCallLogs(notification: Notification) {
    if let callLogs = notification.object as? [CallLog] {
        callLogs.forEach { callLog in
            // Remove the call logs from your call logs array ...
        }
    }
}
```
